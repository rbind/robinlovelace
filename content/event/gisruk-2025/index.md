summary: "Presenting new methods and open source tools for active travel planning by mapping, classifying, and integrating diverse street network datasets at GISRUK 2025."
abstract: "At GISRUK 2025, I'll be presenting in the 'Shaping Cities III: Streets' session. My talk focuses on new methods and open-source tools developed for active travel planning. I will discuss techniques for mapping, classifying, and integrating diverse street network datasets to improve planning outcomes. This work aims to provide practical tools and approaches for researchers and practitioners working towards more sustainable and active transport systems."
