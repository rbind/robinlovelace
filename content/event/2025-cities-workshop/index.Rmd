summary: "This keynote explores future-proofing transport planning through data science and open-source software, drawing on experience with tools like PCT, NPT, and Biclar."
abstract: "Transport planning has always been a complex and multi-disciplinary enterprise requiring wide-ranging skills and methods. Like many fields of research exposed to the data revolution, it is also fast-moving, meaning that itâ€™s hard to know how to keep the work future-proof. This talk will explore the challenges and opportunities of future-proofing transport planning, focusing on the role of data science and open-source software. It will draw on my experience developing and deploying tools such as the Propensity to Cycle Tool for England and Wales (publicly available at [www.pct.bike](https://www.pct.bike/)), the Network Planning Tool for Scotland (publicly available at [www.npt.scot](https://www.npt.scot/)) and the Biclar tool for Portugal (publicly available at [biclar.tmlmobilidade.pt](https://biclar.tmlmobilidade.pt/)). I will also outline some tools and techniques we have developed at the University of Leeds for working with origin-destination data."
