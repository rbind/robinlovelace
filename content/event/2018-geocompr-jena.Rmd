This was the finale of a week of research collaboration and teaching at the Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena [Institut für Geographie](https://www.geographie.uni-jena.de/).
During the study visit I also worked on *Geocomputation with R* with fellow co-author [Jannes Muenchow](https://www.geographie.uni-jena.de/en/Chairs/GIScience/Team/M%C3%BCnchow.html) and wrote a tutorial on route network analysis in R that can be found at https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocomp-tranport-workshop
