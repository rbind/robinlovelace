<p>In place of a planned <a href="https://penniur.upenn.edu/events/musamasterclass-featuring-tyler-morgan-wall-3d-mapping-dataviz-in-r">MUSA Masterclass</a> talk in person, a remote lecture was scheduled via the wonders of new <a href="https://twitter.com/robinlovelace/status/1239930988416897033">digital technologies</a>, on transport data science.</p>
<p>Although not as in-depth as the MUSA Masterclass talk, which has been postponed until April 2021 due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, this talk will give a high-level overview of some of the topics that I will talk about, based on a case study from Leeds, UK, the home of the Institute for Transport Studies.</p>
<p>Context: the ‘MUSA Masterclass’ is a series of seminars commissioned by the Penn
Institute for Urban Research (<a href="https://penniur.upenn.edu/">Penn IUR</a>) of
the University of <a href="https://www.upenn.edu">Pennsylvania</a>.</p>

<li>Slides: <a href="https://www.robinlovelace.net/presentations/2020-04-06-pennsylvania-tds-regional-street.html">Transport Data Science: from regional to street levels</a></li>

<p>It’s great being able to link-up over such huge distances with minimal effort, the new technologies like Zoom are impressive.
In the hope that this is of use to others, I put links out to the slides and talk out on social media, as shown in the tweets below.
Enjoy!</p>
