summary: "My inaugural lecture at the University of Leeds, discussing my work using data science for future-proof transport planning, key career milestones, and my open, reproducible research approach."
abstract: "I'm delighted to be giving my Inaugural Lecture at The University of Leeds. I welcome everyone – colleagues, researchers, students, alumni, and visitors – to celebrate this milestone.\n\nIn this lecture, I'll discuss my work developing evidence for effective and future-proof transport planning using data science. I'll cover key methodological, empirical, and applied contributions from my research journey, including:\n\n*   Developing the national Propensity to Cycle Tool ([www.pct.bike](https://www.pct.bike/))\n*   A secondment to the No. 10 Downing Street data science team\n*   Building data capacity at Active Travel England ([plan.activetravelengland.gov.uk](https://plan.activetravelengland.gov.uk/))\n*   Current projects on integrated transport in Portugal ([biclar.tmlmobilidade.pt](https://biclar.tmlmobilidade.pt/)) and the Network Planning Tool for Scotland.\n\nMy approach emphasizes reproducible, open, and verifiable research. I'm passionate about open source software and community building, leading to R packages and books like *Geocomputation with R* ([r.geocompx.org](https://r.geocompx.org)) and *Geocomputation with Python* ([py.geocompx.org](https://py.geocompx.org)).\n\nA hands-on 'Hackathon' will precede the lecture ([details and sign up at itsleeds.github.io/tds](https://itsleeds.github.io/tds/minihack-transport-data)).\n\n**Schedule:**\n*   16:00 – 16:25: Drinks reception (ITS social space)\n*   16:30 – 17:30: Lecture (Esther Simpson room 1.01)\n*   17:30 - 18:00: Refreshments (ITS social space)"
