abstract: In many large Latin American urban areas such as the São Paulo Metropolitan
  Region (SPMR), growing social and economic inequalities are embedded through high
  spatial inequality in the provision of state schools and affordable public transport
  to these schools. This paper sheds light on the transport-education inequality nexus
  with reference to school accessibility by public transport in the SPMR. To assess
  school accessibility, we develop an accessibility index which combines information
  on the spatial distribution of adolescents, the location of existing schools, and
  the public transport provision serving the school catchment area into a single measure.
  The index is used to measure school accessibility locally across 633 areas within
  the SPMR. We use the index to simulate the impact of a policy aiming at increasing
  the centralisation of public secondary education provision, and find that it negatively
  affects public transport accessibility for students with the lowest levels of accessibility.
  These results illustrate how existing inequalities can be amplified by variable
  accessibility to schools across income groups and geographical space. The research
  suggests that educational inequality impacts of school agglomeration policies should
  be considered before centralisation takes place.
