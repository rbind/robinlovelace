abstract: BackgroundThere is a paucity of population-based geospatial data about the
  association between active transport and myocardial infarction. We investigated
  the association between active transport to work and incidence of myocardial infarction.DesignThis
  ecological study of 325 local authorities in England included 43,077,039 employed
  individuals aged 25?74 years (UK Census, 2011), and 117,521 individuals with myocardial
  infarction (Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project, 2011?2013).MethodsBayesian
  negative binomial regression models were used to investigate the association of
  active transport to work and incidence of myocardial infarction adjusting for local
  levels of deprivation, obesity, smoking, diabetes and physical activity.ResultsIn
  2011, the prevalence of active transportation to work for people in employment in
  England aged 25?74 years was 11.4% (4,531,182 active transporters; 8.6% walking
  and 2.8% cycling). Active transport in 2011 was associated with a reduced incidence
  of myocardial infarction in 2012 amongst men cycling to work (incidence rate ratio
  (95% credible interval) 0.983 (0.967?0.999); and women walking to work (0.983 (0.967?0.999))
  after full adjustments. However, the prevalence of active transport for men and
  women was not significantly associated with the combined incidence of myocardial
  infarction between 2011?2013 after adjusting for physical activity, smoking and
  diabetes.ConclusionsIn England, the prevalence of active transportation was associated
  with a reduced incidence of myocardial infarction for women walking and men cycling
  to work in corresponding local geographic areas. The overall association of active
  transport with myocardial infarction was, however, explained by local area levels
  of smoking, diabetes and physical activity.
