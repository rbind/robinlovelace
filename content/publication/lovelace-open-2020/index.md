abstract: "A large and growing body of evidence suggests fundamental changes are needed\
  \ in transport systems, to tackle issues such as air pollution, physical inactivity\
  \ and climate change. Transport models can play a major role in tackling these issues\
  \ through the transport planning process, but they have historically been focussed\
  \ on motorised modes (especially cars) and available only to professional transport\
  \ planners working within the existing paradigm. Building on the principles of open\
  \ access software, first developed in the context of geographic information systems,\
  \ this paper develops and discusses the concept of open access transport models,\
  \ which we define as models that are both developed using open source software and\
  \ are available to be used by the public without the need for specialist training\
  \ or the purchase of software licences. We explore the future potential of open\
  \ access transport models to support the transition away from fossil fuels in the\
  \ transport sector. We do this with reference to the literature on the use of tools\
  \ in the planning process, and by exploring an example that is already in use: the\
  \ `Propensity to Cycle Tool'. We conclude that open access transport models can\
  \ be a leverage point in the planning process due to their ability to provide robust,\
  \ transparent and actionable evidence that is available to a range of stakeholders,\
  \ not just professional transport planners. Open access transport models represent\
  \ a disruptive technology deserving further research and development, by planners,\
  \ researchers and citizen scientists, including open source software developers\
  \ and advocacy groups but, in order to fulfil their potential, they will require\
  \ both financial and policy support from government bodies."
