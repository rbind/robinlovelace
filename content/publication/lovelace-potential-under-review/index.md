abstract: "Methods for estimating cycling potential for single-mode trips are well-established.\
  \ Less attention has been paid to the question of how to promote cycling as the\
  \ first leg of multi-stage trips involving public transport (PT). This  `bike &\
  \ ride' option has many potential benefits: boosting the level of cycling beyond\
  \ that attainable through promotion of single-mode cycle trips alone; reducing car\
  \ dependency in suburban areas not generally viewed as having high cycling potential;\
  \ and reviving demand for PT services. But how to plan for `bike & ride' uptake?\
  \ This paper presents a reproducible method for estimating bike & ride potential,\
  \ based on geographic analysis of catchment areas and stated preference surveys\
  \ of the relevant population. We illustrate the method using a case study of Seville,\
  \ with insights into suitable locations for new cycle paths and appropriately sized\
  \ cycle parking facilities to encourage bike & ride uptake. Deployed in other cities,\
  \ we conclude that these methods could provide a strong evidence base for the cost-effective\
  \ investment in new suburban cycling infrastructure."
