abstract: $<$p$>$Open access data, open source software and cloud computing are three
  parallel and mutually reinforcing drivers of change in the field of applied geographical
  information systems (GIS). While these developments create many new opportunities
  for GIS users and companies, they are also associated with under-explored risks.
  This chapter investigates cloud GIS, focusing on the Australian Urban Research Infrastructure
  Network (AURIN), an online, cloud-based data portal and GIS designed explicitly
  for Australian urban research and public-sector planning applications. AURIN provides
  direct access to more than 4000 data sets, over 100 spatial analysis tools and powerful
  computational resources that are typically available in desktop GIS. The experience
  of developing, communicating and using AURIN has provided insights into the opportunities
  unleashed by new models of GIS research. This chapter explores those opportunities,
  such as greater accessibility, transparency and consistency in decision support
  for public policy, and risks of cloud GIS and its potential uses for social benefit.$<$/p$>$
