abstract: 'Cycling has a range of benefits as is recognised by national and international
  policies aiming to increase cycling rates. Darkness acts as a barrier to people
  cycling, with fewer people cycling after-dark when seasonal and time-of-day factors
  are accounted for. This paper explores whether road lighting can reduce the negative
  impact of darkness on cycling rates. Changes in cycling rates between daylight and
  after-dark were quantified for 48 locations in Birmingham, United Kingdom, by calculating
  an odds ratio. These odds ratios were compared against two measures of road lighting
  at each location: 1) Density of road lighting lanterns; 2) Relative brightness as
  estimated from night-time aerial images. Locations with no road lighting showed
  a significantly greater reduction in cycling after-dark compared with locations
  that had some lighting. A nonlinear relationship was found between relative brightness
  at a location at night and the reduction in cyclists after-dark. Small initial increases
  in brightness resulted in large reductions in the difference between cyclist numbers
  in daylight and after-dark, but this effect reached a plateau as brightness increased.
  These results suggest only a minimal amount of lighting can promote cycling after-dark,
  making it an attractive mode of transport year-round.'
