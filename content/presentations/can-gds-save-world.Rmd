## Why data carpentry?

- If you 'hack' or 'munge' data, it won't scale
- So ultimately it's about being able to handle Big Data
- We'll cover the basics of data frames and tibbles
- And the basics of **dplyr**, an excellent package for data carpentry
    - **dplyr** is also compatible with the **sf** package

## The data frame

The humble data frame is at the heart of most analysis projects:

```{r}
d = data.frame(x = 1:3, y = c("A", "B", "C"))
d
```

In reality this is a list, making function work on each column:

```{r}
summary(d)
plot(d)
```

## Subsetting

In base R, there are many ways to subset:

```{r}
d[1,] # the first line
d[,1] # the first column
d$x # the first column
d [1] # the first column, as a data frame
```

## The tibble

Recently the data frame has been extended:

```{r}
library("tibble")
dt = tibble(x = 1:3, y = c("A", "B", "C"))
dt
```

## Advantages of the tibble

It comes down to efficiency and usability

 - When printed, the tibble diff reports class
 - Character vectors are not coerced into factors
 - When printing a tibble diff to screen, only the first ten rows are displayed
 
## dplyr

Like tibbles, has advantages over historic ways of doing things

- Type stability (data frame in, data frame out)
- Consistent functions - functions not `[` do everything
- Piping make complex operations easy

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ghg_ems %>%
  filter(!grepl("World|Europe", Country)) %>% 
  group_by(Country) %>% 
  summarise(Mean = mean(Transportation),
            Growth = diff(range(Transportation))) %>%
  top_n(3, Growth) %>%
  arrange(desc(Growth))
```

```{r}
# dplyr must be loaded with
library(dplyr)
```

## Why pipes?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
wb_ineq %>% 
  filter(grepl("g", Country)) %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(gini = mean(gini, na.rm  = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(gini)) %>%
  top_n(n = 5)
```

vs

```{r, eval=FALSE}
top_n(
  arrange(
    summarise(
      group_by(
        filter(wb_ineq, grepl("g", Country)),
        Year),
      gini = mean(gini, na.rm  = TRUE)),
    desc(gini)),
  n = 5)
```

## Subsetting with dplyr

Only 1 way to do it, making life simpler:

```{r}
select(dt, x) # select columns
slice(dt, 2) # 'slice' rows
```

# How we've used this in the PCT

## Worked example: pct data in West Yorksire

- We'll download and visualise some transport data

```{r}
u_pct = "https://github.com/npct/pct-data/raw/master/west-yorkshire/l.Rds"
if(!file.exists("l.Rds"))
  download.file(u_pct, "l.Rds")
library(stplanr)
l = readRDS("l.Rds")
plot(l)
```

## Analysing where people walk

```{r}
sel_walk = l$foot > 9
l_walk = l[sel_walk,]
plot(l)
plot(l_walk, add = T, col = "red")

library(dplyr) # for next slide...
```

## Doing it with sf (!)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
l_walk1 = l %>% filter(All > 10) # fails
```

```{r}
library(sf)
l_sf = st_as_sf(l)
plot(l_sf[6])
```

## Subsetting with sf | much easier

```{r, eval=FALSE}
l_walk2 = l_sf %>% 
  filter(foot > 9)
plot(l_sf[6])
plot(l_walk2, add = T)
```

## Subsetting with sf | results

```{r, echo=FALSE}
l_walk2 = l_sf %>% 
  filter(foot > 9)

# plot the result
plot(l_sf[6])
plot(l_walk2, add = T)
```

## A more advanced example

```{r}
l_sf$distsf = as.numeric(st_length(l_sf))
l_drive_short2 = l_sf %>% 
  filter(distsf < 1000) %>% 
  filter(car_driver > foot)
```

## Result: where people drive short distances rather than drive

```{r}
library(tmap)
tmap_mode("view")
qtm(l_drive_short2)
```

## Overall results: the [PCT](http://pct.bike/)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://previews.magnoliabox.com/corbis/flat/42-32403684/MUS-FAPC2020_500.jpg")
```
