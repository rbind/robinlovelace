The stats19 R package has been updated to version 4.0.0. The main change is a unified column schema that lets you work with 45 years of UK road crash data (1979 to 2024) without running into mismatched column names.

<!--more-->

## Unified schema

Older data files have columns like `carriageway_hazards_historic` while newer ones use `carriageway_hazards`. v4.0.0 detects these variants, merges them into the modern names, and drops the redundant columns.

```r
library(stats19)
crashes = get_stats19(year = 1979:2024, type = "crashes")
```

## Parsing fixes

`read_stats19()` now builds a custom parser from the CSV header, which removes the warnings about unmatched columns that appeared in previous versions. We also fixed a bug where 2024 latitude and longitude values were truncated to integers.

## Missing values

Codes like `-1`, "Code deprecated", and "Data missing or out of range" are now standardised to `NA` during formatting, so `is.na()` works consistently.

## Performance

The package now uses readr Edition 2 by default, which supports multi-threaded parsing. Loading large files is noticeably faster.

## New functions

- `match_tag()` joins government TAG cost estimates (RAS4001) to collision data
- `clean_make()`, `clean_model()`, and `clean_make_model()` standardise the 2,400+ raw strings in the vehicle dataset

## Multi-year downloads

Year ranges now download bulk historic files once and filter efficiently. The 1979 file is also handled correctly (it used to be returned as a catch-all for any older year).

## Feedback wanted

We plan to submit to CRAN soon. Please install, test, and report any issues:

```r
pak::pak("ropensci/stats19")
```
