Today I am presenting at the [Transport Research Board's 2021 Annual](http://www.trb.org/AnnualMeeting/AnnualMeeting.aspx) meeting, aka [#TRB2021](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TRB2021).
I say 'presenting' but in fact, the talk was a pre-record - see the video below!

Information on the talk can be found [here](https://www.robinlovelace.net/talk/open-access-transport-models-from-collaborative-code-to-citizen-science/).

It's based on a recently published paper on 'open access models' which are both based on open source code and, vitally, are available for use by the public without needing specialist training [@lovelace_open_2020].

It also links to a just-published paper in which I review a range of open source transport planning tools [@lovelace_open_2021].

See the interactive slides [here](https://www.robinlovelace.net/presentations/2021-01-21-open-source-transport-tools.html).

And [here](https://www.robinlovelace.net/talk/open-access-transport-models-from-collaborative-code-to-citizen-science/) for a link to the code, video and more!
