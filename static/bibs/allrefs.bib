Lisbon is no exception, as it invests in the implementation of new bike infrastructure. Quantifying the connectivity of such a bicycle network can help evaluate its current state and highlight specific challenges that should be addressed. Therefore, the aim of this study is to develop an exploratory score that allows a quantification of the bicycle network connectivity in Lisbon based on open data. For each part of the city, a score was computed based on how many common destinations (e.g., schools, universities, supermarkets, hospitals) were located within an acceptable biking distance when using only bicycle lanes and roads with low traffic stress for cyclists. Taking a weighted average of these scores resulted in an overall score for the city of Lisbon of only 8.6 out of 100 points. This shows, at a glance, that the city still has a long way to go before achieving their objectives regarding bicycle use in the city.},

Active transport was defined as any walking, jogging or pedal biking for purposes other than enjoyment. Socio-demographic correlates of any active transport participation, meeting current UK guidelines for sufficient activity through active transport, and time spent on active transport, if any, were explored. Results 4941 individuals took part in the survey and data from 80\% were included in the analyses. 28\% of respondents reported any active transport and 19\% were sufficiently active through active transport. Median time spent in active transport, if any, was 40~min per day (inter-quartile range 20\textendash 60~min). Active transport participation was greater in younger people and those without access to a car or van. Being sufficiently active through active transport was additionally associated with being unemployed, being in a less affluent social class, and leaving full time education at an older age. Conclusions There is scope for increasing active transport participation in the UK. That more than two thirds of those who report any active transport are sufficiently active through active transport alone may be a useful health promotion message.},

Vulnerability is the state of susceptibility to harm from exposure to stresses associated with environmental and social change and from the absence of capacity to adapt. Antecedent traditions include theories of vulnerability as entitlement failure and theories of hazard. Each of these areas has contributed to present formulations of vulnerability to environmental change as a characteristic of social-ecological systems linked to resilience. Research on vulnerability to the impacts of climate change spans all the antecedent and successor traditions. The challenges for vulnerability research are to develop robust and credible measures, to incorporate diverse methods that include perceptions of risk and vulnerability, and to incorporate governance research on the mechanisms that mediate vulnerability and promote adaptive action and resilience. These challenges are common to the domains of vulnerability, adaptation and resilience and form common ground for consilience and integration. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Counties with a higher percentage of the population under poverty level, higher percentage of their population in age groups 0\textendash 14, 15\textendash 24, and over 64 and those with increased road mileage and road density have significantly increased crash risk. Total precipitation is significant and positive in the NB models, but not significant with FB. Spatial correlation, time trend, and space\textendash time interactions are significant in the FB injury crash models. County-level FB models reveal the existence of spatial correlation in crash data and provide a mechanism to quantify, and reduce the effect of, this correlation. Addressing spatial correlation is likely to be even more important in road segment and intersection-level crash models, where spatial correlation is likely to be even more pronounced.},

This book provides students in urban transportation, planners and city authorities with requisite knowledge on the causes and the extent to which traffic congestion in Accra, Ghana's capital, conspired with other factors to thwart efforts at improving public transport through the bus rapid transit system.  The book has meticulously triangulated data and theoretical sources, including GIS-based techniques; key informant(in-depth)\& semi-  structured interviews,in addition to the Time-Geographic, Structuration and General Systems theories.  While Accra's intractable traffic congestion primarily collapsed the time-bound express bus service, other unfavorable factors are identified as well.  Thus, efforts by policy makers and planners to curb congestion and improve public transport must entail congestion pricing, proper traffic accidents management and the implementation of a comprehensive land-use-transportation-system master plan.},

At the same time, physical inactivity contributes to adverse health through non-communicable diseases. If policies can increase active transport (walking and cycling) and reduce car use, they could benefit human health and environmental health but the relative impact of different approaches has been under researched. This study estimated change in all-cause mortality and CO2 emissions in greater Nashville, Tennessee (USA) for two scenarios: (a) the propensity to walk and cycle a trip of a given distance increases directly to the same levels as seen in England, and (b) walking and cycling trips increase and travel distance decrease indirectly as a result of a more compact urban form. If the propensity to walk and cycle in Nashville were equal with England, about 339 deaths and about 36 ktCO2e (1\%) of transportation-related CO2 emissions could be avoided per year. The compact urban form scenario could avoid 170 deaths and 370 ktCO2e (10\%) of transportation-related CO2 emissions. In Nashville, both increasing the propensity to use active transport and more compact urban form would have notable public health gains, but a more compact form would have a much bigger effect on emissions.},

Mapping has long been a tool by which ruling bodies could claim their entitlement to lands and peoples. It is this aspect of cartography that James R. Akerman and a group of distinguished contributors address in The Imperial Map. Critically reflecting on elements of mapping and imperialism from the late seventeenth century to the early twentieth century, the essays discuss the nature of the imperial map through a series of case studies of empires, from the Qing dynasty of China, to the Portuguese empire in South America, to American imperial pretensions in the Pacific Ocean, among others. Collectively, the essays reveal that the relationship between mapping and imperialism, as well as the practice of political and economic domination of weak polities by stronger ones, is a rich and complex historical theme that continues to resonate in our modern day.},

The life cycle emissions reductions are found to be 550,000 tons of CO2-equivalents per annum by 2025/2030 with almost 60\% of this coming from a shift from truck to rail freight and 40\% from a shift from air and road travel to high-speed rail travel. In contexts similar to Sweden, it is thus an important issue whether a large increase is required in freight rail capacity anyway, since high-speed rail investments may not be justified for the passenger markets alone. The study also indicates that a substantial share of emissions due to construction of the new railway could be counterbalanced through the reduced need for building and maintaining roads and airports, and for manufacturing cars.},

  abstract = {Cycling injury risk is an important topic, but few studies explore cycling risk in relation to exposure. This is largely because of a lack of exposure data, in other words how much cycling is done at different locations. This paper helps to fill this gap. It reports a case-control study of cycling injuries in London in 2013\textendash 2014, using modelled cyclist flow data alongside datasets covering some characteristics of the London route network. A multilevel binary logistic regression model is used to investigate factors associated with injury risk, comparing injury sites with control sites selected using the modelled flow data. Findings provide support for `safety in numbers': for each increase of a natural logarithmic unit (2.71828) in cycling flows, an 18\% decrease in injury odds was found. Conversely, increased motor traffic volume is associated with higher odds of cycling injury, with one logarithmic unit increase associated with a 31\% increase in injury odds. Twenty-mile per hour compared with 30mph speed limits were associated with 21\% lower injury odds. Residential streets were associated with reduced injury odds, and junctions with substantially higher injury odds. Bus lanes do not affect injury odds once other factors are controlled for. These data suggest that speed limits of 20 mph may reduce cycling injury risk, as may motor traffic reduction. Further, building cycle routes that generate new cycle trips should generate `safety in numbers' benefits.},

  abstract = {This article examines the extent to which protected infrastructure is associated with greater diversity and normalisation of cycling. In the UK, cyclists are predominantly male and often wear distinctive cycle clothing rather than everyday clothes. This is not the case in higher-cycling countries such as the Netherlands and Germany. It has been argued that the UK's demographic skewing may be partly due to poor quality infrastructure which can be off-putting for many, but particularly for women, children and older people. Route choice studies tend to confirm that women are more likely than men to choose routes with greater levels of separation from motor traffic. Other work suggests that if cycling feels unsafe, cyclists may wear specialised cycle clothing such as helmets, which then may itself support a perception of cycling as dangerous. This small-scale exploratory study examines age, gender, and use of specialist clothing in relation to infrastructure type, comparing a recently improved route with separate space for cyclists to parallel busy streets without protected cycle infrastructure. The separated route showed better, though still unequal, demographic balance and a reduced tendency for cyclists to wear helmets and sporty clothing, though not high-visibility items. Infrastructure type is only one factor in route choice, particularly if there is relatively little good infrastructure along key desire lines. However this paper suggests that infrastructure for cycling could help to improve perceptions of safety and the need to wear specialist cycle clothing. In turn this could promote a better demographic balance and normalise cycling.},

In the UK, cycling became embedded in public policy only after policy-making had been variously outsourced to private, quasi-private, and voluntary organisations. The paper argues that this broader context has contributed to the ongoing failure to treat cycling as a strategically important mode meriting substantial national transport funding. Secondly, the paper makes links between a growing policy focus on `active' and `responsible' citizenship, and the dispersal of cycling policy away from transport into other areas including public health and the environment. It is argued that while there are benefits to this construct, it has again helped to maintain cycling as perceived as being peripheral to the main business of `transport'. Cycling policy has been doubly devolved, away from the state, and away from transport. The implications of this for policy and advocacy are discussed and future directions for both are finally outlined.},

A small but growing field analyses the impact that the use of different transport modes has on other road users, for instance, injuries to others per-km driven. Methods This paper moves the analysis of risk posed to others forward by comparing six different vehicular modes, separating road types (major vs minor roads in urban vs rural settings). The comparison of risk posed by men and women for all these modes is also novel. Results Per-vehicle kilometre, buses and lorries pose much the highest risk to others, while cycles pose the lowest. Motorcycles pose a substantially higher per-km risk to others than cars. The fatality risk posed by cars or vans to ORUs per km is higher in rural areas. Risk posed is generally higher on major roads, although not in the case of lorries, suggesting a link to higher speeds. Men pose higher per-km risk to others than women for all modes except buses, as well as being over-represented among users of the most dangerous vehicles. Conclusions Future research should examine more settings, adjust for spatial and temporal confounders, or examine how infrastructure or route characteristics affect risk posed to others. Although for most victims the other vehicle involved is a car, results suggest policy-makers should also seek to reduce disproportionate risks posed by the more dangerous vehicles, for instance, by discouraging motorcycling. Finally, given higher risk posed to others by men across five of six modes analysed, policy-makers should consider how to reduce persistent large gender imbalances in jobs involving driving.},

We collected data on non-injury cycling `incidents' (near misses and other frightening and/or annoying incidents) from 1692 online diaries of cycle trip stages11 A cycle trip stage being a part of a trip made by cycle; for example, cycling to the train station. and incidents, participants having signed up in advance for a specific day. Following data cleaning and coding, a dataset was created covering 1532 diary days and 3994 records of incidents occurring within the UK. Incident rates were calculated and compared to injury risks for cyclists. Cross-tabulation and regression were used to identify factors affecting incident rates and the effect an incident has on the cyclist. Frightening or annoying non-injury incidents, unlike slight injuries, are an everyday experience for most people cycling in the UK. For regular cyclists `very scary' incidents (rated as 3 on a 0\textendash 3 scale) are on average a weekly experience, with deliberate aggression experienced monthly. Per mile, non-injury incidents were more frequent for people making shorter and slower trips. People aged over 55 were at lower risk, as were those cycling at the weekend and outside the morning peak. Incidents that involved motor vehicles, especially those involving larger vehicles, were more frightening than those that did not. Near miss and other non-injury incidents are widespread in the UK and may have a substantial impact on cycling experience and uptake. Policy and research should initially target the most frightening types of incident, such as very close passes and incidents involving large vehicles. Further attention needs to be paid to the experiences of groups under-represented among cyclists, such as women making shorter trips.},

  abstract = {Introduction: This paper analyses three years' data from the People and Places longitudinal study. This study examines the travel behaviour impact of major investments in active travel infrastructure in three Outer London boroughs (the `mini-Hollands programme'). Methods: The People and Places survey, conducted annually in May-June, treats the mini-Holland interventions as a `natural experiment'. Participants in other Outer London boroughs form a control group. The survey had over 3,000 respondents at baseline (May-June 2016). Three follow-up waves each had over 1400 repeat respondents. A difference-in-differences analysis was used to compare changes in active travel uptake in intervention and control groups. Further analysis examines likelihood of meeting targets for past-week active travel and all physical activity. Finally, the article conducts a health economic benefit assessment based on uptake of active travel at Wave 3. Results: At all waves, living close to mini-Holland interventions (`high-dose' areas) was consistently associated with increased duration of past-week active travel, compared with the control group (44.0 extra minutes in Wave 2, 41.0 in Wave 1, and 41.5 in Wave 3). Changes in active travel behaviour were stronger in the high-dose area than in the low-dose area. Most of the increase was in walking. People living in high-dose areas were 13\% more likely at Wave 3 to achieve 140 minutes active travel than people in control areas. People living in high- or low-dose areas in mini-Holland boroughs were more likely to be physically active for 5 days in the past week. The 20- year health economic benefit in high-dose areas from three years' of interventions (costing \textsterling 80 million) is \textsterling 724 million. Conclusion: Ambitious interventions can yield substantial health economic benefits from changes in active travel. This includes early uptake of walking as well as cycling. Most of the increase was in walking but the ratio varied by year.},

Participants portrayed cycling as a practice traversing independence and interdependence, its mix of benefits for the individual and the collective making it an appropriate response to contemporary social problems. In this paper I describe how this can be interpreted as based on a specific notion of cycling citizenship rooted in the embodied practice of cycling in Cambridge (a relatively high cycling enclave within the low-cycling UK). This notion of cycling citizenship does not dictate political persuasion, but carries a distinctive perspective on the proper relation of the individual to their environment, privileging views `from outside' the motor-car.},

This article draws on social movement theory to explore the creation of `pop-up campaign' Londoners on Bikes, formed to pressure the 2012 London mayoral candidates over cycling issues. Interviews and field notes are used to explore the complexities of framing cycling politically and generating a positive cycling identity in the context of stigma. In negotiating these issues, core activists drew upon their experience within other movements, including feminist and environmental campaigns. The paper concludes that the campaign made both distributional (issue-based) and recognition (identity-based) claims, seeking to influence cycling cultures and identities as well as cycling infrastructures.},

Purposes of the modelling are set out and its evolution is described, starting from the basic traffic assignment model and discussing its generalizations and extensions in the search for greater realism-first in steady-state modelling for fixed demand, and then considering variable demand and time dependence. Further progress towards appropriate realism is seen as requiring communication and cooperation between the modellers and the users of models, helped perhaps by combining the advantages of analytical modelling and microsimulation.},

  abstract = {The spatial and transport planning have geographical, economic and environmental constraints and are closely linked to the social and political conditions of each country as well as are well under the influence of globalization forces. This makes it all a highly complex issue and requires a better understanding of the background and products of policies and the interaction of a number of key determinant factors in policy-making and implementation. Within this large picture, the long-term review of different cases may provide useful discussions for the guidance and reinforcement of policy assessment. Therefore, the primary aim of this study is to critically analyze the planning in the Netherlands through examining the issues of governing structure, spatial policy-making, and transport re-structuring. The leading characteristic of the Netherlands is the scarcity of usable land that has raised high and early awareness on spatial development issues and its connections with natural and environmental protection. The functioning of planning systems, and policy aims and measures within the planning documents since the end of the 1950s, have been reviewed and the key planning concepts have been examined by bringing in general and current discussions on the issues. The success and failure in past policy-making and implementations have been highlighted. The policies of the current spatial and transport planning documents have been evaluated by their main policy titles such as compact city, network of cities and sustainable mobility. There is a general consensus that the Netherlands has been developed into a well planned and organized society and has designed leading policies such as the ABC firm location policy. However, a number of issues such as increasing vehicle kilometres, urban decline and sprawl, and some gaps in policy making remain to be the critical planning challenges.},

  abstract = {Using an expanded version of a psychological theory of attitude-behaviour relations, namely the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), scores on factor analysed multi-dimensional attitude statements were used to segment a population of day trip travellers into potential `mode switchers' using cluster analysis. Six distinct psychographic groups were extracted, each with varying degrees of mode switching potential. Each group represents a unique combination of preferences, worldviews and attitudes, indicating that different groups need to be serviced in different ways to optimise the chance of influencing mode choice behaviour. Socio-demographic factors had little bearing on the travel profiles of the segments, suggesting that attitudes largely cut across personal characteristics. The evidence clearly shows that the same behaviour can take place for different reasons and that the same attitudes can lead to different behaviours. The paper asserts that commonly used a priori classifications used to segment populations based on demographic variables or simple behavioural measures may oversimplify the structure of the market. Cluster analysis is rarely used in studies of travel behaviour but this study demonstrates its utility in providing a way of extracting naturally occurring, relatively homogenous and meaningful groups to be used in designing targeted hard and `soft' transport policies.},

This paper addresses that gap by presenting a scenario exercise using an integrated suite of sectoral and whole systems models to explore potential energy pathways in the UK transport sector. Techno-economic driven scenarios are contrasted with one in which social change is strongly influenced by concerns about energy use, the environment and well-being. The `what if' Lifestyle scenario reveals a future in which distance travelled by car is reduced by 74\% by 2050 and final energy demand from transport is halved compared to the reference case. Despite the more rapid uptake of electric vehicles and the larger share of electricity in final energy demand, it shows a future where electricity decarbonisation could be delayed. The paper illustrates the key trade-off between the more aggressive pursuit of purely technological fixes and demand reduction in the transport sector and concludes there are strong arguments for pursuing both demand and supply side solutions in the pursuit of emissions reduction and energy security.},

Transport to school occur twice a day and could improve cardiovascular health in children. Commuter cycling is associated with lower mortality and cardiovascular disease rate in adults, but limited evidence exists in children. METHODS: Participants were 334 children (age 9.7 +/- 0.5 years) who were followed up 6 years later. Mode of travel to school was investigated by questionnaire. Cardiovascular (CVD) risk factors were compared by mode of travel to school both at baseline and at follow up and for subjects who changed mode of transportation. No difference was found between walkers and passive travelers, and these groups were merged in the analysis. RESULTS: A consistent pattern of better CVD risk factor profile in commuter cyclists compared with children using other means of transport was found. Participants, who did not cycle to school at baseline, and who had changed to cycling at follow up, were fitter, had better cholesterol/HDL ratio, better glucose metabolism, and a lower composite CVD risk factor score than those who did not cycle at either time point. CONCLUSION: Cycling to school may contribute to a better cardiovascular risk factor profile in young people.},

  abstract = {Abstract. We study point patterns of events that occur on a network of lines, such as road accidents recorded on a road network. Okabe and Yamada developed a `network K function', analogous to Ripley's K function, for analysis of such data. However, values of the network K-function depend on the network geometry, making interpretation difficult. In this study we propose a correction of the network K-function that intrinsically compensates for the network geometry. This geometrical correction restores many natural and desirable properties of K, including its direct relationship to the pair correlation function. For a completely random point pattern, on any network, the corrected network K-function is the identity. The corrected estimator is intrinsically corrected for edge effects and has approximately constant variance. We obtain exact and asymptotic expressions for the bias and variance of under complete randomness. We extend these results to an `inhomogeneous' network K-function which compensates for a spatially varying intensity of points. We demonstrate applications to ecology (webs of the urban wall spider Oecobius navus) and criminology (street crime in Chicago).},

Empty and full stations in such systems are equally undesirable and disruptive for the operation of the network, since the former turn away potential users while the latter could not be used to terminate bicycle journeys. Repositioning practices have been used in the past to address this situation with partial success. This paper introduces a new planning approach for such activities, addressing both routing and assignment aspects of bicycle repositioning using a fleet of carrier vehicles. A case study on bicycle usage patterns from a large bicycle-sharing scheme is carried out; examples are also provided that demonstrate the behaviour of the algorithm. Implementation concerns and means to improve computational performance are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Background: Over the past two decades, geographical accessibility of urban resources for population living in residential areas has received an increased focus in urban health studies. Operationalising and computing geographical accessibility measures depend on a set of four parameters, namely definition of residential areas, a method of aggregation, a measure of accessibility, and a type of distance. Yet, the choice of these parameters may potentially generate different results leading to significant measurement errors. The aim of this paper is to compare discrepancies in results for geographical accessibility of selected health care services for residential areas (i.e. census tracts) computed using different distance types and aggregation methods. Results: First, the comparison of distance types demonstrates that Cartesian distances (Euclidean and Manhattan distances) are strongly correlated with more accurate network distances (shortest network and shortest network time distances) across the metropolitan area (Pearson correlation greater than 0.95). However, important local variations in correlation between Cartesian and network distances were observed notably in suburban areas where Cartesian distances were less precise. Second, the choice of the aggregation method is also important: in comparison to the most accurate aggregation method (population-weighted mean of the accessibility measure for census blocks within census tracts), accessibility measures computed from census tract centroids, though not inaccurate, yield important measurement errors for 5\% to 10\% of census tracts. Conclusion: Although errors associated to the choice of distance types and aggregation method are only important for about 10\% of census tracts located mainly in suburban areas, we should not avoid using the best estimation method possible for evaluating geographical accessibility. This is especially so if these measures are to be included as a dimension of the built environment in studies investigating residential area effects on health. If these measures are not sufficiently precise, this could lead to errors or lack of precision in the estimation of residential area effects on health.},

  abstract = {While much focus has been placed on the physical activity and environmental benefits of providing safe and livable streets for children, few studies look at the mental health and cognitive development benefits from lowering children׳s exposure to threats from traffic. In response, this study uses innovative cognitive mapping methods through a series of focus-group interviews with nine and ten-year schoolchildren to uncover important ways traffic exposure limits children׳s cognitive development of their spatial knowledge. To test for these effects, this study focuses on schoolchildren in two similar suburban neighborhoods and schools in suburbs in the San Francisco Bay Area, but differing in the volume and speed of traffic the students are exposed to during their journeys to and from school. The Cognitive mapping exercises and methods used in this research reveal multi-dimensional effects, including how exposure to traffic, as determined by volume, speed, and the adequacy of walking and bicycling infrastructure, limits children׳s progression along a cognitive development continuum of spatial knowledge. Specifically, the results show that without adequate pedestrian and bicycle facilities to provide sanctuary from automobile traffic, children are overcome by the negative senses of danger and dislike, commensurate with a limited ability to identify qualities of their neighborhood that are memorable, special, or even positive. In contrast, this study finds that children allowed to have higher levels of interaction with the environment, through independent, active travel modes improve their spatial knowledge development. By making neighborhood streets safe, comfortable, and livable, this research establishes some key psychological cognitive benefits associated with lowering a child׳s exposure to automobile traffic by providing adequate pedestrian and bicycle Safe Routes to School (SR2S) infrastructure.fx1},

Nowadays datasets often have upwards of thousands---sometimes tens or hundreds of thousands---of variables and far fewer samples. To meet this challenge, we have developed a new R package called sparsebn for learning the structure of large, sparse graphical models with a focus on Bayesian networks. While there are many existing software packages for this task, this package focuses on the unique setting of learning large networks from high-dimensional data, possibly with interventions. As such, the methods provided place a premium on scalability and consistency in a high-dimensional setting. Furthermore, in the presence of interventions, the methods implemented here achieve the goal of learning a causal network from data. Additionally, the sparsebn package is fully compatible with existing software packages for network analysis.},

Consumer-grade GPS units without differential correction have a published horizontal positional accuracy of approximately 10\textendash 15 m (average positional accuracy). An attractive option for differential correction for these GPS units is the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS). Most consumer-grade GPS units on the market are WAAS capable. According to the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), the WAAS broadcast message provides integrity information about the GPS signal as well as accuracy improvements, which are reported to improve accuracy to 3\textendash 5 m. Limited empirical evidence has been published on the accuracy of WAAS-enabled GPS compared to autonomous GPS. An empirical study was conducted comparing the horizontal and vertical accuracy of WAAS-corrected GPS and autonomous GPS under ideal conditions using consumer-grade receivers. Data were collected for 30-min time spans over accurately surveyed control points. Metrics of median, 68th and 95th percentile, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and average positional accuracy in the horizontal and vertical dimensions were computed and statistically compared. No statistically significant difference was found between WAAS and autonomous position fixes when using two different consumer-grade units. When using WAAS, a third unit type exhibited a statistically significant improvement in positional accuracy. Analysis of data collected for a 27-h time span indicates that while WAAS is altering the estimated position of a point compared to an autonomous position estimate, WAAS augmentation actually appears to decrease the positional accuracy.},

Two different travel documents are available, travel passes and pay-per-use, with different validation rules: check-in only for travel passes and check-in and check-out for pay-per-use.Data produced by this electronic ticketing system employing smart cards allow to perform a detailed analysis of each user's behaviour, and calculate time and space distributions of each passenger trip. In detail, data originating from smart card transactions allow to trace back the trip chains, establish journey origins and destinations, and produce a ``travel diary'' for each passenger. Based on this data, performance indicators (i.e. load factor) as well as user mobility patterns and origin-destination matrices can be calculated in an automated and reliable way.This article presents a methodology for assessing the quality of the data collected when information about boarding and alighting stops is available from the (on board) validation system. It also presents an algorithm to assign a destination for each trip where only the boarding information is available.In the case study of the Province of Cuneo, it was found that 91\% of the pay-per-use journey data are reliable and can be used for further analysis, whereas with the use of the proposed algorithm it was possible to estimate the destinations for 82\% of the travel pass trips.},

The efficient placement, sizing and grid connection of charging stations for electric cars makes it even more important to know the spatio-temporal distribution of car parking densities on the scale of entire cities. Here, we generate car parking density maps using travel time measurements only. We formulate a Hidden Markov Model that contains non-linear functional relationships between the changing average travel times among the zones of a city and both the traffic activity and flow direction probabilities of cars. We then sample the traffic flow for 1,000 cars per city zone for each city from these probability distributions and normalize the resulting spatial parking distribution of cars in each time step. Our results cover the years 2015\textendash 2018 for 34 cities worldwide. We validate the model for Melbourne and reach about 90\% accuracy for parking densities and over 93\% for circadian rhythms of traffic activity.},

  abstract = {Carbon Emissions Pinch Analysis (CEPA) is a recent extension of traditional thermal and mass pinch analysis to the area of emissions targeting and planning on a macro-scale (i.e. economy wide). This paper presents an extension to the current methodology that accounts for increased demand and a carbon pinch analysis of the New Zealand electricity industry while illustrating some of the issues with realising meaningful emissions reductions. The current large proportion of renewable generation (67\% in 2007) complicates extensive reduction of carbon emissions from electricity generation. The largest growth in renewable generation is expected to come from geothermal generation followed by wind and hydro. A four fold increase in geothermal generation capacity is needed in addition to large amounts of new wind generation to reduce emissions to around 1990 levels and also meet projected demand. The expected expansion of geothermal generation in New Zealand raises issues of GHG emissions from the geothermal fields. The emissions factors between fields can vary by almost two orders of magnitude making predictions of total emissions highly site specific. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Geographic space has evolved from being largely neglected in the study of innovative activity to being an integrating unit of observation for analysis. Geographic space provides the platform not just for the creation of new knowledge but also, as a result of the spillover process, for the commercialization of that knowledge. The spatial paradox inherent in innovative activity is that knowledge spills over from the source producing it to the entity actually commercializing that knowledge, which would seemingly suggest that geographic location is irrelevant for accessing new knowledge. The paradox emerges because knowledge spillovers are localized and tend to decay rapidly with transmission across geographic space. Geographic space provides a unit of analysis integrating the various agents-individuals, networks, and enterprises-involved in the innovative process into a coherent unit. This coherent unit clearly extends beyond the boundaries of individual firms yet is defined by geographic space.},

The analysis of route data provides useful insight for understanding factors affecting travel behavior and in this case provides quantitative support for many exist- ing assumptions regarding commuter cyclist behavior. Most com- muters divert very little from their minimum path (0.4 km on average) and are found to use major road routes. The cyclists tend to avoid grades, grade-separated railway crossings, and high-activity areas, but not road (as opposed to pedestrian) bridges. Cyclists use traffic signals especially for crossing major roadways and turning. The high-quality direct off-road paths are used only infrequently by the commuter cyclists and the lower quality ones even less. The results of this analy- sis suggest that efforts to accommodate current commuter cyclists should be focused on improving cycling conditions on the road net- work, such as providing wider curb lanes, or actuated traffic signal detectors that recognize the presence of bicycles. If potential new com- muters are similar to the minority of current commuter cyclists in this study who use mainly local roads, paths or trails, then projects that make the network of local roads and pathways more connective and direct may encourage a higher level of commuter cycling.},

The study is based on results from a 1.72 kWp PV system installed on a flat rooftop in Dublin, Ireland. During its first year of operation a total of 885.1 kWh/kWp of electricity was generated with a performance ratio of 81.5\%. The scenarios employed in this study consider: a range of capital costs; cost dynamics based on a PV module learning rate of 20{$\pm$}5\%; projections for global annual installed PV capacity under an advanced and moderate market growth conditions; domestic electricity cost growth of 4.5\% based on historic data; and a reduction of 25\% or 50\% in the CO2 intensity of national electricity production by 2055. These scenarios are used to predict when system life cycle production costs fall to grid prices (grid parity). Average NPV and electricity generation costs ranged from -\texteuro 14,330 and 0.58 \texteuro/kWh and were close to zero and 0.18 \texteuro/kWh for a system installed in 2009 and 2030, respectively. However, under optimistic conditions NPVs are positive for systems installed after 2021 and grid parity occurs in 2016. Findings are compared with similar international studies.},

In their traditional form, these alternative transport modes do not always offer the flexibility or convenience of the car; therefore, innovative solutions have been developed to allow active and public transport to compete better with the car. Shared bicycle systems have been adopted by a growing number of cities and regions throughout the world, yet little is known about the users of the systems and their motivations. A survey was conducted in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, in the summer of 2010 to determine the factors that encouraged individuals to use the system and the elements that influenced frequency of use. The factor found to have the greatest effect on the likelihood for use of a shared bicycle system was the proximity of home to docking stations. Ownership of a yearly shared bicycle membership was associated with cyclists riding shared bicycles 15 additional times per year. Respondents indicated that they valued the shared bicycle's trendy status and the role that it could play in bicycle theft prevention. The potential of shared bicycle systems can be maximized by increasing the number of docking stations in residential neighborhoods and by emphasizing the popularity of shared bicycles and theft prevention in advertising campaigns.},

Sa cartographie a pour objectif de repr\'esenter graphiquement ces valeurs. Pour cela, elle les transforme en figur\'es lin\'eaires, ponctuels et/ou zonaux puis les projette dans un espace assorti d'une m\'etrique commun\'ement g\'eographique. Lorsque la matrice est dense, cette approche pourtant bien connue pose de nombreuses difficult\'es d'ordres m\'ethodologique et pratique, des contraintes graphiques et des d\'efis techniques et technologiques qu'il convient de r\'esoudre au risque de produire une figure illisible, caract\'eristique de l'effet spaghetti. La r\'eponse traditionnellement apport\'ee consiste \`a simplifier la figure en s\'electionnant l'information \`a repr\'esenter et/ou en r\'eduisant sa r\'esolution.

Quelles en sont les raisons ? Est-ce \`a dire que les solutions \`a ces probl\`emes cartographiques seraient exclusivement num\'eriques ? Que signifie in fine repr\'esenter des valeurs de flux sur une carte ? La th\`ese s'inscrit dans l'objectif g\'en\'eral de r\'eduction de la complexit\'e inh\'erente au processus de cartographie d'une matrice de flux.

  abstract = {This article addresses how collaborative geospatial/geovisual decision support systems (C-GDSS) can achieve greater measures of spatial justice within an institutional, democratic framework for public goods allocation. Current public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) and participatory geographic information science (P-GIS) literature identifies issues of scale and consensus as problematic for such systems. C-GDSS deployments aimed at achieving spatial justice through small-scale, consensual processes fail when scaled to large processes involving heterogeneous groups where consensus is not realistically achievable. For this case study, we identify a significant deficit in the quality of public involvement in transportation infrastructure (TI) planning and design in the United States. We call this the Arnstein Gap. This exists in part because professionals lack confidence that they can integrate community cultural values, despite C-GDSS use, and have come to fear public engagement. To close the Arnstein Gap using C-GDSS we reconsider relationships among landscape, justice, and difference. The nature of power in the U.S. democratic polity and TI's role is examined and a geographical justice framework is derived from Rawls's (1971) theory of justice. We argue that within the normative framework of Jeffersonian democracy in the United States, spatial justice cannot be attained through an epistemology of distributional justice. Instead, it can more feasibly be attained by increasing procedural justice and access to justice. From these principles we develop a more suitable methodology for reflexive, large-scale group deployment of such systems termed structured public involvement (SPI). SPI holds that large-scale, nonconsensual collaborative TI planning is not oxymoronic, nor is it morally or practically inferior to other options. Methodological consideration is given to how geospatial and geovisual technologies can be used in TI design to elicit and respect cultural preferences. SPI consists of a reflexive public involvement framework that situates these technologies as dialogic media in participatory, nonconsensual collaborative planning and design. Two SPI case studies are discussed. AMIS is a participatory multicriteria/GIS corridor evaluation methodology and CAVE is a fuzzy-logic-based visual evaluation methodology. Anonymous real-time public process evaluation data demonstrate SPI's high performance. We discuss impediments, such as project sponsor's preferred Arnstein level, public participation patterns, professional resistance, and other considerations. This work has implications for collaborative public goods decision making using geovisual/geospatial methods in participatory democracies.},

  abstract = {The role of traditional media and the Internet in relation to young people's political participation has attracted a great deal of scholarly attention. Starting from a notion of differential media use and an encompassing notion of political participation, this article tests the relationships between media use (newspaper, television, and Internet) and offline and online forms of political participation. Findings from a national survey (n = 2,409, age 16 to 24) reveal that a variety of Internet uses are positively related with different forms of political participation, whereas the relationship between most uses of traditional media and participation are weak, albeit positive. The study rejects the predictive power of duration of media use but finds support for the type of media use. Positive relationships between online communication and noninformational uses of the Internet vis-\`a-vis participation are found. The research demonstrates how a wider and more contemporary conception of political participation, together with more detailed measures of media use, can help to gain better insight in the roles media can play in affecting participatory behavior among the Internet generation.},

  abstract = {Among the realistic ingredients to be considered in the computational modeling of infectious diseases, human mobility represents a crucial challenge both on the theoretical side and in view of the limited availability of empirical data. To study the interplay between short-scale commuting flows and long-range airline traffic in shaping the spatiotemporal pattern of a global epidemic we (i) analyze mobility data from 29 countries around the world and find a gravity model able to provide a global description of commuting patterns up to 300 kms and (ii) integrate in a worldwide-structured metapopulation epidemic model a timescale-separation technique for evaluating the force of infection due to multiscale mobility processes in the disease dynamics. Commuting flows are found, on average, to be one order of magnitude larger than airline flows. However, their introduction into the worldwide model shows that the large-scale pattern of the simulated epidemic exhibits only small variations with respect to the baseline case where only airline traffic is considered. The presence of short-range mobility increases, however, the synchronization of subpopulations in close proximity and affects the epidemic behavior at the periphery of the airline transportation infrastructure. The present approach outlines the possibility for the definition of layered computational approaches where different modeling assumptions and granularities can be used consistently in a unifying multiscale framework.},

  abstract = {There is debate about the problems of communication between scientists, planners and stakeholder, and the scale at which environmental planning should take place. A review of the literature reveals that the concept of holistic landscape ecology is gaining ground in the scientific community. It also becomes clear that participation by stakeholders is not only important in satisfying the requirements of Agenda 21 but also of ensuring cooperation by local inhabitants in the final plan. Moreover, participation is becoming accepted as a vehicle for the planners to gain access to local knowledge, which is a vital complement to scientific knowledge. The challenge is to create a methodology that will overcome the shortfalls currently encountered and allow participants to be proactive in their definition of their landscape. This is possible by extending the experiments in public participation geographical information systems so long as care is taken to overcome problems in public unfamiliarity with the technology. The purpose of this paper is to draw together research in the fields of landscape ecology and planning to enable the formulation of a methodology for achieving greater and more proactive input in participation. The methodology proposed is currently actionable and this paper also points to the potential for a new emphasis in research. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The literatures on planning and policy analysis, decision support systems, and geographic information systems (GIS) and science (GIScience) are used to construct a historical footprint. The conceptual linkages between GIScience, public participation GIS (PPGIS), participatory GIS (PGIS), and CGIS are also outlined. The conclusion is that collaborative GIS is centrally positioned on a participation spectrum that ranges from the individual to the general public, and that an important goal is to use argumentation, deliberation, and maps to clearly structure and reconcile differences between representative interest groups. Hence, collaborative GIS must give consideration to integrating experts with the general public in synchronous and asynchronous space-time interactions. Collaborative GIS provides a theoretical and application foundation to conceptualize a distributive turn to planning, problem solving, and decision making.},

In Inequality in Transport, David Banister addresses this complex problem, first through an exploration of inequality, its nature, measurement and extent. He then links inequality and the transport sector through detailed analysis of the variations in daily and long-distance travel in Great Britain over a ten-year period. He argues that there must be a much wider interpretation of inequality--one that links actual travel with measures of wellbeing and sustainability, recognizing that these will change over time. In drawing his findings together, he concludes that there must be new thinking in transport policy and planning if transport inequalities are to be alleviated.},

  abstract = {Most people value and enjoy the benefits that the use of their own car brings to their quality of life. These benefits are reflected in the increases in travel, the use of more resources, and the production of more pollution. However, this situation is not sustainable. In this paper the author argues the case for planning playing an instrumental role in achieving sustainability objectives in transport. It reviews the contributions that economics (pricing) and technological measures might have. The conclusion reached is that the scale of price increases required to achieve a reduction in car use will not be politically acceptable. Similarly, technological improvements may only give us a breathing space before more positive action is necessary. Even if the environmental problems created by the car are solved, there will always be the underlying problem of congestion. The only alternative is to travel shorter distances, to develop the potential for linking activities, and to use the car less \textendash{} this is where planning has a key role.Three main actions are proposed to avoid the need to travel. The first is the implementation of a set of development principles through examining the role that density and settlement size might have on urban sustainability. This issue is particularly important given the current debate at all levels in the United Kingdom over housing allocations and the possibility of a new generation of new settlements. The second action explores the concept of the social audit and the social costs associated with the closure of existing facilities and the opening of new facilities, many of which are inaccessible to those without a car. There have been savings to the provider of the facility through economies of scale, but additional costs have been transferred to the users of these facilities. The social audit would examine all the costs and benefits of these decisions, with a view to subsidy to prevent closure and a tax on greenfield developments to help pay for the redevelopment of brownfield sites within urban areas. The third action is to create quality neighbourhoods in cities to maintain and promote communities with high enviromental quality and no congestion. It is only through maintaining and improving environmental quality that urban sustainability can be enhanced, as these locations must form the focus for development. They allow for the provision of clean public transport, they would promote walk and cycling, and they would reduce levels of car dependence.},

  abstract = {Crucial components of carbon offset trading schemes are the determination of whether a technology or practice is innovative (i.e. not common practice), and whether the practice is adopted as a result of incentives (termed additional). Under schemes such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), early adopters of carbon reducing technologies receive tradable carbon credits that can be sold to businesses to offset their emissions. However, frameworks for distinguishing early adopters are inconsistent, and the effect of incentive schemes on uptake is poorly understood. In this study we: 1) review measures of common practice taken from the literature with the purpose of informing a standardised approach; and 2) using the Bass model we explore the effects of incentive schemes on adoption with the purpose of establishing the proportion of uptake attributable to the scheme. We found that a fixed common practice threshold of approximately 20\% adoption is well supported by a wide range of approaches, and that 85\textendash 95\% (approximately) of early adoption can be attributed to incentives, such as offset schemes. Although we focussed on carbon reducing technologies, our results have broad implications for general practice and product diffusion, and the effect of promotions on adoption.},

By exploring the practices and affordances of cycling, we offer a discussion of everyday mobility, public life and urban space in post-socialist Sofia. This case study incorporates ethnography and in-depth interviews with regular cyclists. Through a discussion of bicycling spaces and practices, this paper complicates the notion of post-socialist cities as places defined by the decline of public sensibilities.},

The pandemic drove a mass social experiment in which half of all paid hours were provided from home between May and October 2020. Our survey evidence says that 22 percent of all full work days will be supplied from home after the pandemic ends, compared with just 5 percent before. We provide evidence on five mechanisms behind this persistent shift to working from home: diminished stigma, better-than-expected experiences working from home, investments in physical and human capital enabling working from home, reluctance to return to pre-pandemic activities, and innovation supporting working from home. We also examine some implications of a persistent shift in working arrangements: First, high-income workers, especially, will enjoy the perks of working from home. Second, we forecast that the postpandemic shift to working from home will lower worker spending in major city centers by 5 to 10 percent. Third, many workers report being more productive at home than on business premises, so post-pandemic work from home plans offer the potential to raise productivity as much as 2.4 percent.},

However, researchers, policy makers, and citizens who want to make use of OpenStreetMap (OSM) have little information about whether it can be relied upon in a particular geographic setting. In this paper, we use two complementary, independent methods to assess the completeness of OSM road data in each country in the world. First, we undertake a visual assessment of OSM data against satellite imagery, which provides the input for estimates based on a multilevel regression and poststratification model. Second, we fit sigmoid curves to the cumulative length of contributions, and use them to estimate the saturation level for each country. Both techniques may have more general use for assessing the development and saturation of crowd-sourced data. Our results show that in many places, researchers and policymakers can rely on the completeness of OSM, or will soon be able to do so. We find (i) that globally, OSM is {$\sim$}83\% complete, and more than 40\% of countries\textemdash including several in the developing world\textemdash have a fully mapped street network; (ii) that well-governed countries with good Internet access tend to be more complete, and that completeness has a U-shaped relationship with population density\textemdash both sparsely populated areas and dense cities are the best mapped; and (iii) that existing global datasets used by the World Bank undercount roads by more than 30\%.},

The work presented in this paper focuses only on the mobility behaviour of such large populations and this is simulated using an activity-based approach in which the travel demand is derived from the activities performed by the individuals. The proposed model is distribution-based and requires only minimal information, but is designed to easily take advantage of any additional network-related data available. The proposed activity-based approach has been applied to the Belgian synthetic population. The quality of the agent behaviour is discussed using statistical criteria extracted from the literature and results show that VirtualBelgium produces satisfactory results.},

  abstract = {The advent of microsimulation in the transportation sector has created the need for extensive disaggregated data concerning the population whose behavior is modeled. Because of the cost of collecting this data and the existing privacy regulations, this need is often met by the creation of a synthetic population on the basis of aggregate data. Although several techniques for generating such a population are known, they suffer from a number of limitations. The first is the need for a sample of the population for which fully disaggregated data must be collected, although such samples may not exist or may not be financially feasible. The second limiting assumption is that the aggregate data used must be consistent, a situation that is most unusual because these data often come from different sources and are collected, possibly at different moments, using different protocols. The paper presents a new synthetic population generator in the class of the Synthetic Reconstruction methods, whose objective is to obviate these limitations. It proceeds in three main successive steps: generation of individuals, generation of household type's joint distributions, and generation of households by gathering individuals. The main idea in these generation steps is to use data at the most disaggregated level possible to define joint distributions, from which individuals and households are randomly drawn. The method also makes explicit use of both continuous and discrete optimization and uses the ?2 metric to estimate distances between estimated and generated distributions. The new generator is applied for constructing a synthetic population of approximately 10,000,000 individuals and 4,350,000 households localized in the 589 municipalities of Belgium. The statistical quality of the generated population is discussed using criteria extracted from the literature, and it is shown that the new population generator produces excellent results.},

We take into account many realistic features like: traffic days, walking between stations, queries between geographic locations instead of a source and a target station, and multi-criteria cost functions. Our algorithm is based on two key observations: (1) many shortest paths share the same transfer pattern, i.e., the sequence of stations where a change of vehicle occurs; (2) direct connections without change of vehicle can be looked up quickly. We precompute the respective data; in practice, this can be done in time linear in the network size, at the expense of a small fraction of non-optimal results. We have accelerated public transportation routing on Google Maps with a system based on our ideas. We report experimental results for three data sets of various kinds and sizes.},

  abstract = {As urban planning moves from a centralized, top-down approach to a decentralized, bottom-up perspective, our conception of urban systems is changing. In Cities and Complexity, Michael Batty offers a comprehensive view of urban dynamics in the context of complexity theory, presenting models that demonstrate how complexity theory can embrace a myriad of processes and elements that combine into organic wholes. He argues that bottom-up processes in which the outcomes are always uncertain can combine with new forms of geometry associated with fractal patterns and chaotic dynamics to provide theories that are applicable to highly complex systems such as cities. Batty begins with models based on cellular automata (CA), simulating urban dynamics through the local actions of automata. He then introduces agent-based models (ABM), in which agents are mobile and move between locations. These models relate to many scales, from the scale of the street to patterns and structure at the scale of the urban region. Finally, Batty develops applications of all these models to specific urban situations, discussing concepts of criticality, threshold, surprise, novelty, and phase transition in the context of spatial developments. Every theory and model presented in the book is developed through examples that range from the simplified and hypothetical to the actual. Deploying extensive visual, mathematical, and textual material, Cities and Complexity will be read both by urban researchers and by complexity theorists with an interest in new kinds of computational models.},

We first sketch our vision defining seven goals which concern: developing a new understanding of urban problems; effective and feasible ways to coordinate urban technologies; models and methods for using urban data across spatial and temporal scales; developing new technologies for communication and dissemination; developing new forms of urban governance and organisation; defining critical problems relating to cities, transport, and energy; and identifying risk, uncertainty, and hazards in the smart city. To this, we add six research challenges: to relate the infrastructure of smart cities to their operational functioning and planning through management, control and optimisation; to explore the notion of the city as a laboratory for innovation; to provide portfolios of urban simulation which inform future designs; to develop technologies that ensure equity, fairness and realise a better quality of city life; to develop technologies that ensure informed participation and create shared knowledge for democratic city governance; and to ensure greater and more effective mobility and access to opportunities for urban populations. We begin by defining the state of the art, explaining the science of smart cities. We define six scenarios based on new cities badging themselves as smart, older cities regenerating themselves as smart, the development of science parks, tech cities, and technopoles focused on high technologies, the development of urban services using contemporary ICT, the use of ICT to develop new urban intelligence functions, and the development of online and mobile forms of participation. Seven project areas are then proposed: Integrated Databases for the Smart City, Sensing, Networking and the Impact of New Social Media, Modelling Network Performance, Mobility and Travel Behaviour, Modelling Urban Land Use, Transport and Economic Interactions, Modelling Urban Transactional Activities in Labour and Housing Markets, Decision Support as Urban Intelligence, Participatory Governance and Planning Structures for the Smart City. Finally we anticipate the paradigm shifts that will occur in this research and define a series of key demonstrators which we believe are important to progressing a science of smart cities.},

  abstract = {The recent proliferation of bike share schemes (BSS, also known as public bicycle use programs) in many cities has focused attention on their potential for reducing motorised traffic congestion, improving air quality and reducing car use. Since 2005, hundreds of bike share schemes have been implemented in many cities, with bike share usage patterns monitored in many of them. This paper assesses the development of BSS and provides a rationale for their potential health benefits. The key research question, as yet unanswered, is whether BSS themselves can contribute to improving population health, particularly through increasing population cycling, which would increase population levels of health-enhancing physical activity. This paper presents a framework for evaluating the contribution of BSS to population physical activity, and uses examples of new data analyses to indicate the challenges in answering this question. These illustrative analyses examine cycling in Australia, and [i] compares rates of cycling to work in BSS cities compared to the rest of Australia over time, and [ii] modelling trends in bike counts in Central Melbourne before and after introduction of the BSS in 2010, and compared to adjacent regions in nearby suburbs unexposed to a BSS. These indicative examples point to difficulties in attributing causal increases in cycling for transport to the introduction of a BSS alone. There is an evidence gap, and a need to identify opportunities to improve the health-related components of BSS evaluations, to answer the question whether they have any impact on population physical activity levels.},

This approach takes account of techno-economic, environmental and social criteria, and engages explicitly with inherent network complexity in terms of the autonomous decision-making capability of individual agents within the network, who may choose not to act as economic rationalists. This is an important consideration from the standpoint of meeting sustainable development goals. The approach attempts to set targets for energy planning, by determining preferred network development pathways through multi-objective optimization. The viability of such plans is then explored through agent-based models. The combined approach is demonstrated for a case study of regional electricity generation in South Africa, with biomass as feedstock.},

  abstract = {Background: Understanding factors that influence the distance that drivers provide when passing cyclists is critical to reducing subjective risk and improving cycling participation. This study aimed to quantify passing distance and assess the impact of motor vehicle and road infrastructure characteristics on passing distance. Methods: An on-road observational study was conducted in Victoria, Australia. Participants had a custom device installed on their bicycle and rode as per their usual cycling for one to two weeks. A hierarchical linear model was used to investigate the relationship between motor vehicle and infrastructure characteristics (location, presence of on-road marked bicycle lane and the presence of parked cars on the kerbside) and passing distance (defined as the lateral distance between the end of the bicycle handlebars and the passing motor vehicle). Results: Sixty cyclists recorded 18,527 passing events over 422 trips. The median passing distance was 173\,cm (Q1: 137\,cm, Q3: 224\,cm) and 1085 (5.9\%) passing events were less than 100\,cm. Relative to sedans, 4WDs had a reduced mean passing distance of 15\,cm (Q1: 12\,cm, Q3: 17\,cm) and buses had a reduced mean passing distance of 28\,cm (Q1: 16\,cm, Q3: 40\,cm). Relative to passing events that occurred on roads without a marked bicycle lane and without parked cars, passing events on roads with a bike lane with no parked cars had a reduced mean passing distance of 27\,cm (Q1: 25\,cm, Q3: 29\,cm), and passing events on roads with a bike lane and parked cars had a mean lower passing distance of 40\,cm (Q1: 37\,cm, Q3: 43\,cm). Conclusions: One in every 17 passing events was a close ({$<$}100\,cm) passing event. We identified that on-road bicycle lanes and parked cars reduced passing distance. These data can be used to inform the selection and design of cycling-related infrastructure and road use with the aim of improving safety for cyclists.},

  abstract = {A high and sustainable quality of life is a central goal for humanity. Our current socio-ecological regime and its set of interconnected worldviews, institutions, and technologies all support the goal of unlimited growth of material production and consumption as a proxy for quality of life. However, abundant evidence shows that, beyond a certain threshold, further material growth no longer significantly contributes to improvement in quality of life. Not only does further material growth not meet humanity's central goal, there is mounting evidence that it creates significant roadblocks to sustainability through increasing resource constraints (i.e., peak oil, water limitations) and sink constraints (i.e., climate disruption). Overcoming these roadblocks and creating a sustainable and desirable future will require an integrated, systems level redesign of our socio-ecological regime focused explicitly and directly on the goal of sustainable quality of life rather than the proxy of unlimited material growth. This transition, like all cultural transitions, will occur through an evolutionary process, but one that we, to a certain extent, can control and direct. We suggest an integrated set of worldviews, institutions, and technologies to stimulate and seed this evolutionary redesign of the current socio-ecological regime to achieve global sustainability.},

Methods: Studies conducted between January 2000 and December 2010 were identified by a systematic search in Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, Psychinfo, Sportdiscus, Sociological Abstracts, and Social Service Abstracts. English-language peer-reviewed studies undertaken in the general population of adults (18\textendash 65 years) were classified by domain of PA (total, leisure-time including sport, occupational, active transport), indicator of socioeconomic position (education, income, occupation), and European region. Distributions of reported positive, negative, and null associations were evaluated. Results: A total of 131 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most studies were conducted in Scandinavia (n = 47). Leisure-time PA was the most frequently studied PA outcome (n = 112). Considerable differences in the direction of inequalities were seen for the different domains of PA. Most studies reported that those with high socioeconomic position were more physically active during leisure-time compared to those with low socioeconomic position (68\% positive associations for total leisure-time PA, 76\% for vigorous leisure-time PA). Occupational PA was more prevalent among the lower socioeconomic groups (63\% negative associations). Socioeconomic differences in total PA and active transport PA did not show a consistent pattern (40\% and 38\% positive associations respectively). Some inequalities differed by European region or socioeconomic indicator, however these differences were not very pronounced. Conclusions: The direction of socioeconomic inequalities in PA in Europe differed considerably by domain of PA. The contradictory results for total PA may partly be explained by contrasting socioeconomic patterns for leisure-time PA and occupational PA.},

Yet, whilst its military and economic power has undoubtedly been weakened, it continues to exert power and influence and to promote national interests via the exercise of both hard and soft power. Far from representing a novel strategy, this simultaneous deployment of both forms of power may be considered as a continuation of the dual imperial strategy of gunboat diplomacy and winning hearts and minds at home and abroad. Yet, the postcolonial era does represent some novelty: as was clear under the Conservative-led coalition and is now evident under a Conservative majority government, soft power is no longer exercised principally via cultural diplomacy, through, for example, the British Council, but increasingly via large companies which promote British economic and political interests through corporate imperialism.},

However, while attributes of the physical environment are widely investigated, sociocultural, political, and economic aspects of the environment are often neglected. This article helps to fill these knowledge gaps by providing a more comprehensive understanding of multiple dimensions of the community environment relative to physical activity. The purpose of this study was to qualitatively explore how people's experiences and perceptions of their community environments affect their abilities to engage in physical activity. A PhotoVoice method was used to identify barriers to and opportunities for physical activity among residents in four communities in the province of Alberta, Canada, in 2009. After taking pictures, the thirty-five participants shared their perceptions of those opportunities and barriers in their community environments during individual interviews. Using the Analysis Grid for Environments Linked to Obesity (ANGELO) framework, themes emerging from these photoelicited interviews were organized in four environment types: physical, sociocultural, economic, and political. The data show that themes linked to the physical (56.6\%) and sociocultural (31.4\%) environments were discussed more frequently than the themes of the economic (5.9\%) and political (6.1\%) environments. Participants identified nuanced barriers and opportunities for physical activity, which are illustrated by their quotes and photographs. The findings suggest that a myriad of factors from physical, sociocultural, economic, and political environments influence people's abilities to be physically active in their communities. Therefore, adoption of a broad, ecological perspective is needed to address the barriers and build upon the opportunities described by participants to make communities more healthy and active.},

For promoting cycling during winter, the maintenance service level of cycleways is of importance. Earlier studies indicated that the Swedish public is unsatisfied with the service levels provided on cycleways during winter. In Sweden, cycleways normally are cleared of snow through plowing and are gritted for skid control. Field studies tested an unconventional winter maintenance method that uses a power broom for snow clearance and salt for deicing. The field studies were evaluated through road-condition observations, measurements of friction, a questionnaire survey, interviews, and bicycle measurements. The method of using a power. broom for snow clearance and salt for deicing provided a higher service level than traditional winter maintenance methods, but it was two to three times more expensive. The method has greater potential in regions, such as southern Sweden, with low snow accumulations but with major ice-formation problems than in regions with a colder climate. Cyclists noticed. the improved maintenance service level provided with the method used in the field study, but although cyclists stated that road condition is important to their decision to cycle, it could not be concluded that the enhanced service level generated a higher winter cycling frequency.},

  abstract = {In this Swedish study, the attitudes towards cycling during winter in general, and in relation to winter maintenance of cycleways in particular, is examined. Questionnaires were answered by a thousand employees at four major companies in two Swedish cities. There was a clear difference in mode choice between seasons. The number of car trips increased by 27\% from summer to winter while the number of bicycle trips decreased by 47\%. The number of car trips increased with distance while the number of bicycle trips decreased, and the decrease was even more significant in winter than in summer. There was a difference in opinion between different categories of cyclists, on what factors influenced the choice of transport mode for the journey to work. Temperature, precipitation, and road condition were the most important factors to those who cycled to work in summer but not in winter. Exercise was the most important to those who cycled frequently in winter, and travel time the most important to those who never cycled to work. By improving winter maintenance service levels on cycleways, it might be possible to increase the number of bicycle trips during winter by 18\%, representing a corresponding decrease in the number of car trips of 6\%. To increase cycling during winter, snow clearance was found to be the most important maintenance measure. Skid control was not considered as important for the choice of mode, although important to attend to for safety reasons. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

From a constructionist perspective, the democratic 'effects' of non-proprietary software are contingent on how the practice of free and open-source software is discursively represented and constituted as it is translated into new e-government systems. On these premises, an analysis of official discourse and government policy for non-proprietary software suggests that its introduction into government will bring more 'politics as usual' rather than democratisation. Nevertheless, on the basis of an alternative discourse of ethics and freedom evident in the Free Software and Open Source communities, the authors of this paper envisage circumstances in which the discourse and practice of non-proprietary software contribute to opening-up and democratising e-government, by protecting and extending transparency and accountability in e-governments and by offering scope for technology to be shaped by citizens and associations as well as by administrators and private interests.},

Increasingly, however, the Internet is being used to explore the use of online visualisation and mapping tools, with evaluation often taking the form of feedback questionnaires that are used to refine such techniques. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how innovative visualisation techniques can enhance existing methods of information provision and public participation in a renewable energy setting. Specifically, we are concerned with examining participant opinions on the use of such tools to promote participation in relation to a proposed wind farm in South Wales. Our findings suggest that survey participants are generally optimistic regarding the potential for such software and overall give strong support for the development and implementation of these technologies in a real-world planning context. However, we suggest that such techniques need to be carefully tailored to the types of public engagement being sought in order to link particular tasks to specific technology types.},

  abstract = {Stringent long-term climate targets necessitate a limit on cumulative emissions in this century for which sufficient policy signals are lacking. Using nine energy-economy models, we explore how policies pursued during the next two decades impact long-term transformation pathways towards stringent long-term climate targets. Less stringent near-term policies (i.e., those with larger emissions) consume more of the long-term cumulative emissions budget in the 2010\textendash 2030 period, which increases the likelihood of overshooting the budget and the urgency of reducing GHG emissions after 2030. Furthermore, the larger near-term GHG emissions associated with less stringent policies are generated primarily by additional coal-based electricity generation. Therefore, to be successful in meeting the long-term target despite near-term emissions reductions that are weaker than those implied by cost-optimal mitigation pathways, models must prematurely retire significant coal capacity while rapidly ramping up low-carbon technologies between 2030 and 2050 and remove large quantities of CO2 from the atmosphere in the latter half of the century. While increased energy efficiency lowers mitigation costs considerably, even with weak near-term policies, it does not substantially reduce the short-term reliance on coal electricity. However, increased energy efficiency does allow the energy system more flexibility in mitigating emissions and, thus, facilitates the post-2030 transition.},

This paper shows the application of a generalized linear modeling technique for the analysis of road accidents on the Indian National Highway. Speed, traffic flow and road characteristics data on four-lane dived rural highway in Dahod are analyzed. The study proposes a novel approach to include average daily traffic (ADT) and average spot speed (AS) in the accident prediction model for a rural highway. The model has been developed for accidents per km as a dependent variable and significant variables such as Junction density, village settlement nearby, ADT, AS as~independent variables. The findings from the model offer a better estimate of accidents for a multilane divided rural highway. Statistical Models cannot fully reflect the characteristics of each section due to the heterogeneous nature of road accidents, so the association rule mining technique has been used to identify accident spots as it can deal with the heterogeneous nature of accidents. Accident spots have been assessed by correlating various attributes to the severity of the accident (fatal, non-fatal). This research will help to improve road safety on rural highways.},

The project is founded by Fondazione di Comunit`a Milano; Politecnico di Milano is the scientific partner, while the other partners are associations that represent people with disabilities: Spazio Vita Niguarda Onlus, Ledha Milano and AUS Niguarda Onlus. The mapping elements of interest for the project were identified in collaboration with the other partners, also studying the state of the art. In the framework of Open Street Map, a comparison between different existing mapping techniques was done to select the optimal compromise between rigour and simplicity. In addition, the different techniques must be suitable for the chosen tagging scheme to map accessibility elements. The techniques analysed involve the use of paper maps, Field Papers, and street-level images or applications for smartphones. They are compared to identify the best one.},

In the context of a new emphasis on participation in central government policy rhetoric and planning guidance, we examine the rationales, methods, and outcomes of recent public participation initiatives. Through drawing on a questionnaire survey distributed to all English highway authorities and a content analysis of provisional local transport policy documents, we explore not only the extent of activity and innovation in public participation, but identify and reflect upon the failures of current practice and the barriers which constrain further development. We conclude that, although examples of at least partial success in developing carefully conceptualised, inclusive, and meaningful participation programmes can be identified, most have been grounded in political expediency. Motivations for seeking public involvement have been instrumental in nature rather than drawing on wider substantive and normative arguments. It is suggested that issues relating to both the supply of opportunities and the level of demand have a role to play in understanding and potentially resolving current barriers to involvement. However, we also stress the need to step back from this dualistic analytical framework and instead to consider the significance of the broader political context and motivations for public participation. It is concluded that future developments in public participation will need to move beyond innovation in terms of technique alone, increasingly to engage with issues relating to the purpose of participation, the management of process acid outcomes, and structural conditions which influence individual decisions about 'taking part'.},

Significantly, the research, across a range of stakeholder groups, reveals a deeply problematic relationship between citizen involvement and established structures of democratic decision-making. Attention is drawn to the institutional constraints which account for the limited realisation of the participatory agenda in local governance.

Poor surface pavement quality manifests itself in terms of vibrations of a bicycle. This strongly influences the perception of a cycle track, general cycling comfort and the route choice as well. We introduce dynamic comfort index (DCI) which is capable of objectively describing the vibration properties of surface pavement on a track. The DCI is derived from data gathered when riding a bicycle equipped with a GPS device and an accelerometer. The most common types of devices were selected to make the DCI widely applicable. We tested DCI values on various bicycles and surface pavements. DCI values on individual cycling tracks were compared with the subjective feelings of 43 cyclists via questionnaires. A strong correlation (\`A0.94) was obtained between the objectively measured DCI values and the subjectively assessed evaluations. This makes the DCI approach transferable to any other environment. This method has been applied to an entire road network within the historical center of the city of Olomouc (Czech Republic). It can further be used by bicycle track administrators to monitor surface quality, by planners to obtain relevant surface pavement values, and by individual cyclists for optimal route choice.},

  abstract = {Transport and public health researchers have a shared interest in the promotion of active travel. Walking and cycling are activities that may help to achieve health benefits while also contributing to wider sustainability goals, such as a reduction in carbon emissions from transport, improvements in air quality, and reduced congestion. A variety of interventions have been used to promote travel behaviour change, for example, infrastructure change and personalised travel planning. Some researchers have directed their interest towards the potential of technology and visual representation to motivate and engage individuals to increase their sustainability practices. Computer visualisation tools may be an instrument to prompt behaviour change, leading to a shift towards more active modes of travel. Visualisation technology has been used for many purposes, including raising awareness of global environmental problems, scenario modelling, and the representation of walking and cycling futures. Recently, the availability of large datasets has led to the visualisation of system-usage data from cycle-hire schemes. Elsewhere, various representations of personal journey data have been evaluated in terms of their capabilities to change behaviour. Currently, it is thought that the technical possibilities of visualisations exceed the knowledge of their correct application. Therefore, methods and guidelines for producing and applying visualisations are required. To our knowledge there has been no evaluation of the use of a visualisation that shows infrastructure change to promote active travel. In this study participants were asked to watch a computer visualisation of a new walking and cycling route in Glasgow. This animated visualisation included an existing segregated cycling facility and pedestrian and cyclist bridge. Eleven semistructured interviews and two focus groups considered the potential utility of visualisation in promoting a new walking and cycling facility and identified any limitations of this approach and potential improvements. The results suggested that visualisation technology has the potential to stimulate debate on in-journey accounts of active travel and the embodied experience of cycling. The built environment and psychosocial factors that culminate in road-user conflicts were discussed. The perception of nonmotorised modes of transport as risky was not overlooked by participants, who shared their knowledge of cycling road safety and `correct' walking and cycling behaviours. Participants responded positively to the appearance of protection from traffic achieved by the new routes. However, many criticised the limited coverage of the visualisation and low traffic volumes. The decision to cycle is often made in the context of real-life constraints that were not replicated fully in this visualisation. Further development of visualisation technology may be needed before it can be used successfully for active travel interventions. \textcopyright{} 2014 Pion and its Licensors.},

It is recognised that large buses hold the promise of relieving the growing congestion of African cities if they are managed efficiently and sustainably. It is in line with this that this study seeks to explore the reasons behind commuters' non-preference of Metro Mass Transit (MMT) for intra-city commuting in Accra, Ghana. A revealed preference survey was administered to 134 commuters to find out the reasons behind their non-preference and their perception of the level of service (LOS) delivery of the Metro Mass Transit. The Study revealed that though Metro Mass Transit was 20\% cheaper in terms of price, commuters perceived its service delivery as poor. Over-crowding of buses, non-adherence to time schedule, long in-vehicle time, perception of not getting access to seats, non-availability of bus at respondents' origins and destinations, accessibility of alternative modes and long waiting times for buses accounted for the major reasons for non-preference. Metro Mass Transit Limited's improvement in its service attributes especially in-vehicle time, waiting time, comfort, reliability and accessibility is a means of increasing its modal share. Adherence to these is the surest way to achieving the objective of promoting mass transit in Accra by shifting people from the use of unsustainable modes such as mini-buses and taxis to the use of efficient high capacity systems as Metro Mass Transit.},

  abstract = {The aim of this article is to explore the main issues involved with operationalizing entropy-maximizing models in a retail business context. We draw on our experiences of work undertaken with a variety of international blue-chip clients. First, we examine issues relating to demand estimation, focusing on practical considerations involved in different types of application. These issues include choice of demand estimation methodology, dealing with nonresidential flows and demand elasticity. Second, we investigate the supply-side or attractiveness component in detail, including a review of how such factors as brand preference, brand loyalty, and the so-called network effect can be addressed within a spatial interaction modeling framework. We then explore the distance decay variable in more detail before examining more specific measures of model performance. Historically in the literature, goodness of fit has been used as a measure of model performance, but we shall argue that goodness of forecast is the metric by which model performance should be measured. The difficulties of trying to achieve this are outlined and some examples discussed. El objetivo de este art\'iculo es explorar la problem\'atica de la puesta en pr\'actica de modelos de maximizaci\'on de entrop\'ia en el contexto de los negocios de ventas al consumidor (retail). Los autores utilizan su experiencia de trabajo con varios clientes de primer orden (blue-chip clients). Primero, se examina la problem\'atica de la estimaci\'on de la demanda, centr\'andose en las consideraciones pr\'acticas de diferentes tipos de aplicaciones. Esta problem\'atica incluye la selecci\'on de una metodolog\'ia para la estimaci\'on de la demanda, el problema de flujos no-residenciales, y la elasticidad de la demanda. Segundo, se investiga en detalle el componente de oferta o atractividad, lo que incluye un examen de la forma en que factores como la preferencia y lealtad de marca, y el efecto de red (network effect) pueden ser abordados dentro del marco del modelado de interacci\'on espacial. Luego se investiga el efecto de disminuci\'on por distancia (distance decay) en m\'as detalle para luego examinar medidas m\'as espec\'ificas de performance de modelo. En la literatura especializada, la bondad de ajuste (goodness of fit) ha sido utilizada como medida de performance de modelos m\'as com\'un, pero los autores sostienen que la bondad de predicci\'on (goodness of forecast) es una m\'etrica m\'as apropiada. Finalmente, se presentan las dificultades existentes para alcanzar dicho tipos de medidas y se proporcionan algunos ejemplos.},

The application of a methodology for generating synthetic microdata from a number of different aggregate sources is reported. The resultant information system can be used in a flexible manner to product distributions not currently available from aggregate sources. Additionally, the microdata form direct inputs into microsimulation models.

  abstract = {Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R, second edition, is divided into two basic parts, the first presenting R packages, functions, classes and methods for handling spatial data. This part is of interest to users who need to access and visualise spatial data. Data import and export for many file formats for spatial data are covered in detail, as is the interface between R and the open source GRASS GIS and the handling of spatio-temporal data. The second part showcases more specialised kinds of spatial data analysis, including spatial point pattern analysis, interpolation and geostatistics, areal data analysis and disease mapping. The coverage of methods of spatial data analysis ranges from standard techniques to new developments, and the examples used are largely taken from the spatial statistics literature. All the examples can be run using R contributed packages available from the CRAN website, with code and additional data sets from the book's own website. Compared to the first edition, the second edition covers the more systematic approach towards handling spatial data in R, as well as a number of important and widely used CRAN packages that have appeared since the first edition. This book will be of interest to researchers who intend to use R to handle, visualise, and analyse spatial data. It will also be of interest to spatial data analysts who do not use R, but who are interested in practical aspects of implementing software for spatial data analysis. It is a suitable companion book for introductory spatial statistics courses and for applied methods courses in a wide range of subjects using spatial data, including human and physical geography, geographical information science and geoinformatics, the environmental sciences, ecology, public health and disease control, economics, public administration and political science. The book has a website where complete code examples, data sets, and other support material may be found: http://www.asdar-book.org. The authors have taken part in writing and maintaining software for spatial data handling and analysis with R in concert since 2003.},

  abstract = {Norway has become a global forerunner in the field of electromobility and the BEV market share is far higher than in any other country. One likely reason for this is strong incentives for promoting purchase and ownership of BEVs. The purpose of this study is to describe the role of incentives for promoting BEVs, and to determine what incentives are critical for deciding to buy a BEV and what groups of buyers respond to different types of incentives. The questions are answered with data from a survey among nearly 3400 BEV owners in Norway. Exemptions from purchase tax and VAT are critical incentives for more than 80\% of the respondents. This is very much in line with previous research, which suggests that up-front price reduction is the most powerful incentive in promoting EV adoption. To a substantial number of BEV owners, however, exemption from road tolling or bus lane access is the only decisive factor. Analyses show that there are clear delineations between incentive groups, both in terms of age, gender, and education. Income is a less prominent predictor, which probably results from the competitive price of BEVs in the Norwegian market. Perhaps most interesting is the assumed relation between incentives and character of transport systems the respondents engage in.},

This is due to the lack of tools that can ease the measurement of a level of service adapted to disabled people, and also to the limitation concerns about the availability of information regarding the existing level of service, especially in real time. This paper describes preliminary results to progress on those needs. It also includes a design for a navigation tool that can help a disabled person move around a city by suggesting the most adapted routes according to the person's disabilities. The main topics are how to use advanced computer vision technologies, and how to benefit from the prevalence of handheld devices. Our approach intends to show how crowdsourcing techniques can improve data quality by gathering and combining up-to-date data with valuable field observations.},

The rate of this projected rise is based on ice-sheet melting simulations and downplays discoveries of more rapid ice loss. Knowing the rate at which sea level reached its highstand during the last interglacial period is fundamental in assessing if such rapid ice-loss processes could lead to future catastrophic sea-level rise. The best direct record of sea level during this highstand comes from well-dated fossil reefs in stable areas. However, this record lacks both reef-crest development up to the full highstand elevation, as inferred from widespread intertidal indicators at +6 m, and a detailed chronology, owing to the difficulty of replicating U-series ages on submillennial timescales. Here we present a complete reef-crest sequence for the last interglacial highstand and its U-series chronology from the stable northeast Yucat\'an peninsula, Mexico. We find that reef development during the highstand was punctuated by reef-crest demise at +3 m and back-stepping to +6 m. The abrupt demise of the lower-reef crest, but continuous accretion between the lower-lagoonal unit and the upper-reef crest, allows us to infer that this back-stepping occurred on an ecological timescale and was triggered by a 2-3-m jump in sea level. Using strictly reliable (230)Th ages of corals from the upper-reef crest, and improved stratigraphic screening of coral ages from other stable sites, we constrain this jump to have occurred approximately 121 kyr ago and conclude that it supports an episode of ice-sheet instability during the terminal phase of the last interglacial period.},

  abstract = {There has been a succession of policy documents related to active travel published by the British government since the implementation of a National Cycle Network (NCN) in 1995. However, as the latest National Travel Survey (NTS) reveals, the number of journeys made by bike in the UK has remained steadfastly around only 2\% (Department for Transport [DfT], 2018a). By using documentary analysis of the available official policy documents and statements, the aim of this paper is to make sense of the policies that have been published concerning active travel (AT) in England. This is done from a figurational sociological perspective. Three key themes emerge from the analysis: (1) the rhetorical, advisory level of the vast majority of the policies; (2) the reliance on a wide network of local authorities to implement AT policy; and (3) the focus placed on individuals to change their behaviour. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that despite a large number of policy publications from a range of government departments claiming to promote AT, little has actually changed in this time period in terms of a national agenda. Despite the successive policies, it seems there is little appetite on behalf of recent governments to make widespread infrastructural changes, where instead the focus has largely been on persuading the individual to seek more active modes of travel, increasingly for their own, individual `health' gains.},

It is a complex issue, and for years companies, governments and civil society have vigorously apportioned blame with little to show in the way of practical results. Since its publication in the early '90s, Brenda Boardman's Fuel Povertyhas been the keystone text for those wishing to learn about this controversial subject. In this, its successor, she turns a critical eye to the new millennium and finds that the situation, while now more widely recognized, is far from having improved. The book begins by discussing the political awakening to the issue and exploring just who constitutes the fuel poor, and how this has changed in recent decades. It examines the traditional and emerging drivers for the problem, and looks at and evaluates the policies that have been employed to help alleviate the problem. The latter part presents a detailed set of proposals based around long-term improvements in housing stock that must be employed if we are to avoid a seemingly inexorable slide in the face of political best intentions.},

OSMnx contributes five significant capabilities for researchers and practitioners: first, the automated downloading of political boundaries and building footprints; second, the tailored and automated downloading and constructing of street network data from OpenStreetMap; third, the algorithmic correction of network topology; fourth, the ability to save street networks to disk as shapefiles, GraphML, or SVG files; and fifth, the ability to analyze street networks, including calculating routes, projecting and visualizing networks, and calculating metric and topological measures. These measures include those common in urban design and transportation studies, as well as advanced measures of the structure and topology of the network. Finally, this article presents a simple case study using OSMnx to construct and analyze street networks in Portland, Oregon.},

Nevertheless, its use by practitioners is generally limited. The goal of this study is to explore the challenges and opportunities experienced by land use and transportation practitioners to use accessibility metrics in their work. In order to achieve this objective, a survey on the use of accessibility metrics was conducted among 343 practitioners around the world. Findings from the survey show a gap between knowledge of the concept of accessibility and its use by land use and transportation practitioners. While 90\% of the respondents are familiar with the concept, only 55\% stated that they use accessibility metrics in their work. Whereas lack of support and interest does not appear to be a major obstacle to using accessibility metrics, lack of knowledge and data are highlighted as the main barriers to the use of metrics in practice. These results suggest that further training and collaboration is required to support the use of metrics by practitioners. Furthermore, including clear accessibility indicators in planning documents is key to promoting the use of metrics in policy and practice, as it was stated as a main reason motivating the generation of accessibility metrics. This research highlights potential avenues to support the integration of accessibility metrics in practice and is of relevance to researchers, planners and policy-makers wishing to foster accessibility-based planning approaches.},

Does this also apply to societies at large, i.e. can societies experience mood states that affect their collective decision making? By extension is the public mood correlated or even predictive of economic indicators? Here we investigate whether measurements of collective mood states derived from large-scale Twitter feeds are correlated to the value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) over time. We analyze the text content of daily Twitter feeds by two mood tracking tools, namely OpinionFinder that measures positive vs. negative mood and Google-Profile of Mood States (GPOMS) that measures mood in terms of 6 dimensions (Calm, Alert, Sure, Vital, Kind, and Happy). We cross-validate the resulting mood time series by comparing their ability to detect the public's response to the presidential election and Thanksgiving day in 2008. A Granger causality analysis and a Self-Organizing Fuzzy Neural Network are then used to investigate the hypothesis that public mood states, as measured by the OpinionFinder and GPOMS mood time series, are predictive of changes in DJIA closing values. Our results indicate that the accuracy of DJIA predictions can be significantly improved by the inclusion of specific public mood dimensions but not others. We find an accuracy of 86.7\% in predicting the daily up and down changes in the closing values of the DJIA and a reduction of the Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) by more than 6\%. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Methods: Year-20 data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study (3549 black and white adults aged 38-50 years in 2005-2006) were analyzed in 2008-2009. Sociodemographic correlates of transportation mode (car-only, walk-only, any cycling, other) to neighborhood amenities were examined in multivariable multinomial logistic models. Gender-stratified multivariable linear or multinomial regression models compared CVD risk factors across transit modes. Results: Active transit was most common to parks and public transit stops; walking was more common than cycling. Among those who used each amenity, active transit (walk-only and any cycling versus car-only transit) was more common in men and those with no live-in partner and less than full-time employment (significant ORs [95\% CI] ranging from 1.56 [1.08, 2.27] to 4.54 [1.70, 12.14]), and less common in those with children. Active transit to any neighborhood amenity was associated with more favorable BMI, waist circumference, and fitness (largest coefficient [95\% CI] -1.68 [-2.81, -0.55] for BMI, -3.41 [-5.71, -1.11] for waist circumference [cm], and 36.65 [17.99, 55.31] for treadmill test duration [seconds]). Only cycling was associated with lower lifetime CVD risk classification. Conclusions: Active transit to neighborhood amenities was related to sociodemographics and CVD risk factors. Variation in health-related benefits by active transit mode, if validated in prospective studies, may have implications for transportation planning and research. \textcopyright{} 2009 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

The recent policy shift towards integrated transport has been accompanied by significant institutional changes, which have created a new framework for transport planning, with important implications for public involvement. Yet many issues underlying the new participative approach to transport planning have yet to be resolved. In this paper, the wider socio-political context for increasing inclusivity in planning processes is discussed, followed by a brief analysis of the condition of public involvement in transport planning in Britain. A conceptual framework then draws together the issues to be considered when planning programmes for public involvement in transport planning.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Active commuting (AC) is a behavior with many documented health benefits; however, influences on AC are not well understood. This paper examined a range of influences on self-reported AC behavior. METHODS: Participants in Manhattan, KS, responded to an online survey (August-December 2008) with questions about walking, biking and driving patterns, influences on AC (motivators, barriers, self-efficacy, and workplace factors) and demographics. Separate logistic regression models predicted if participants walked, biked, or drove to work at least once/week according to the demographic factors and influences on AC, and significant factors were examined simultaneously in a multivariate logistic model. RESULTS: Participants (n=375) were primarily young to middle aged adults, female, Caucasian, with at least a high school education, and 24.2\% reported AC one or more times per week. Univariate analyses revealed several demographic variables, employment related factors, barriers, and motivators significantly associated with walking, biking, and driving. The multivariate models found multiple significant predictors associated with walking (Nagelkerke R(2)=0.685), biking (Nagelkerke R(2)=0.717), and driving (Nagelkerke R(2)=0.799). CONCLUSIONS: AC is a complex behavior and this study noted a wide range of significant influences. These results provide insight for the development of policies and programs to enhance population level AC.},

Calculations are performed for the integrated radiative forcing and mean temperature change, for different time horizons and various measures of transport work. An unambiguous ranking of the specific climate impact can be established for freight transportation, with shipping and rail having lowest and light trucks and air transport having highest specific impact for all cases calculated. Passenger travel with rail, coach or two- and three-wheelers has on average the lowest specific climate impact also on short time horizons.

  abstract = {Because of their high level of integration, centralised energy supply systems are vulnerable to disturbances in the supply chain. In the case of electricity especially, this supply paradigm is losing some of its appeal. Apart from vulnerability, a number of further aggravating factors are reducing its attractiveness. They include the depletion of fossil fuels and their climate change impact, the insecurities affecting energy transportation infrastructure, and the desire of investors to minimise risks through the deployment of smaller-scale, modular generation and transmission systems. Small-scale decentralised systems, where energy production and consumption are usually tightly coupled, are emerging as a viable alternative. They are less dependent upon centralised energy supply, and can sometimes use more than one energy source. They are less sensitive to the uncertain availability of remote primary energy and transportation networks. In addition, the close connection between energy generation and use makes decentralised systems cleaner because they are most often based on renewable energies or on high-efficiency fossil fuel-based technologies such as combined heat and power (CHP). Fully decentralised energy supply is not currently possible or even truly desirable. The secure and clean energy systems of the future will be those flexible enough to allow for a spectrum of hybrid modes of operation and investment, combining the best attributes of both paradigms. A large part of this flexibility will come from the networks that make it possible to combine these two types of infrastructures and obtain the benefits of both approaches. \textcopyright{} 2008 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.},

  abstract = {Objective Many research papers examine the relationship of the built environment on transport behaviour using only one mode of transport. Yet to inform policy makers, a broader examination of transport mode choice across different transport modes is required. Here, associations between urban design attributes and transport mode choices including transport walking, transport cycling, public transport and private motor vehicle use were explored. Methods Secondary analysis was conducted on 16,890 participants aged 18 years or older who participated in the Victorian Integrated Survey of Travel Activity 2009\textendash 2010 (VISTA09) in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. Adjusted multilevel logistic regression models were used to explore the relationship between urban design attributes and transport-walking, cycling, public transport and private motor vehicle use. Results Taking transport-walking, cycling or public transport trips was positively associated with the housing diversity score and gross dwelling density. Taking private motor vehicle trips was negatively associated with street connectivity, land use mix, local living score, housing diversity score, gross dwelling density and proximity to supermarkets. Conclusion The study found that environments that neighbourhoods with gross residential densities exceeding 20 dwellings per hectare, a well-connected street network, access to 9 or more local living destinations and short distances to public transport services (i.e., {$\leq$} 400 m for bus and {$\leq$} 800 m for train) encourage walking, cycling and public transport use, while discouraging driving. Comprehensive integrated urban planning of transport infrastructure, land use development and service provision is required to create neighbourhoods that support active and sustainable living that allow for a flexible mix of land uses and transport options.},

  abstract = {The transition to a low carbon transport world requires a host of demand and supply policies to be developed and deployed. Pricing and taxation of vehicle ownership plays a major role, as it affects purchasing behavior, overall ownership and use of vehicles. There is a lack in robust assessments of the life cycle energy and environmental effects of a number of key car pricing and taxation instruments, including graded purchase taxes, vehicle excise duties and vehicle scrappage incentives. This paper aims to fill this gap by exploring which type of vehicle taxation accelerates fuel, technology and purchasing behavioral transitions the fastest with (i) most tailpipe and life cycle greenhouse gas emissions savings, (ii) potential revenue neutrality for the Treasury and (iii) no adverse effects on car ownership and use. The UK Transport Carbon Model was developed further and used to assess long term scenarios of low carbon fiscal policies and their effects on transport demand, vehicle stock evolution, life cycle greenhouse gas emissions in the UK. The modeling results suggest that policy choice, design and timing can play crucial roles in meeting multiple policy goals. Both CO2 grading and tightening of CO2 limits over time are crucial in achieving the transition to low carbon mobility. Of the policy scenarios investigated here the more ambitious and complex car purchase tax and feebate policies are most effective in accelerating low carbon technology uptake, reducing life cycle greenhouse gas emissions and, if designed carefully, can avoid overburdening consumers with ever more taxation whilst ensuring revenue neutrality. Highly graduated road taxes (or VED) can also be successful in reducing emissions; but while they can provide handy revenue streams to governments that could be recycled in accompanying low carbon measures they are likely to face opposition by the driving population and car lobby groups. Scrappage schemes are found to save little carbon and may even increase emissions on a life cycle basis. The main policy implication of this work is that in order to reduce both direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions from transport governments should focus on designing incentive schemes with strong up-front price signals that reward `low carbon' and penalize `high carbon'. Policy instruments should also be subject to early scrutiny of the longer term impacts on government revenue and pay attention to the need for flanking policies to boost these revenues and maintain the marginal cost of driving.},

However, only a few attempts have been made to integrate all of these insights into systems models of future transport energy demand or even scenario analysis. This paper addresses this gap in research and practice by presenting the development and use of quantitative scenarios using an integrated transport-energy-environment systems model to explore four contrasting futures for Scotland that compare transport-related `lifestyle' changes and socio-cultural factors against a transition pathway focussing on transport electrification and the phasing out of conventionally fuelled vehicles using a socio-technical approach. We found that radical demand and supply strategies can have important synergies and trade-offs between reducing life cycle greenhouse gas and air quality emissions. Lifestyle change alone can have a comparable and earlier effect on transport carbon and air quality emissions than a transition to EVs with no lifestyle change. Yet, the detailed modelling of four contrasting futures suggests that both strategies have limits to meeting legislated carbon budgets, which may only be achieved with a combined strategy of radical change in travel patterns, mode and vehicle choice, vehicle occupancy and on-road driving behaviour with high electrification and phasing out of conventional petrol and diesel road vehicles. The newfound urgency of `cleaning up our act' since the Paris Agreement and Dieselgate scandal suggests that we cannot just wait for the `technology fix'.},

In the UK, various macro-economic and energy system wide, top-down models are used to explore the potential for energy demand and carbon emissions reduction in the transport sector. These models can lack the bottom-up, sectoral detail needed to simulate the effects of integrated demand and supply-side policy strategies to reduce emissions. Bridging the gap between short-term forecasting and long-term scenario ``models'', this paper introduces a newly developed strategic transport, energy, emissions and environmental impacts model, the UK Transport Carbon Model (UKTCM). The UKTCM covers the range of transport\textendash energy\textendash environment issues from socio-economic and policy influences on energy demand reduction through to life cycle carbon emissions and external costs. The model is demonstrated in this paper by presenting the results of three single policies and one policy package scenario. Limitations of the model are also discussed. Developed under the auspices of the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) the UKTCM can be used to develop transport policy scenarios that explore the full range of technological, fiscal, regulatory and behavioural change policy interventions to meet UK climate change and energy security goals.},

  abstract = {Monitoring was carried out of particulate concentrations whilst simultaneously walking and driving 48 routes in London, UK. Monitoring was undertaken during May and June 2005. Route lengths ranged from 601 to 1351 m, and most routes were travelled in both directions. Individual journey times ranged from 1.5 to 15 min by car (average 3.7 min) and 7.3 to 30 min (average 12.8 min) whilst walking; car trips were therefore repeated up to 5 times for each single walking trip and the results averaged for the route. Car trips were made with windows closed and the ventilation system on a moderate setting. Results show that mean exposures while walking are greatly in excess of those while driving, by a factor 4.7 for the coarse particle mass (PM10\textendash PM2.5), 2.2 for the fine particle mass (PM2.5\textendash PM1), 1.9 for the very fine particle mass (bPM1) and 1.4 for ultrafine particle number density. The reduced in-car exposures appear to occur largely because the filtration system helps to prevent ingress of particles, so that the vehicle acts as a more-or-less independent micro-environment, insulated against much of air pollution present in the street. When account is also taken of the additional travel time involved in walking, these excesses are further increased: to factors of 15.6, 7.4, 6.5 and 4.4, respectively. Individuals who change their travel mode from car to walking in response to policies aimed at encouraging a modal shift in travel behavior are thus likely to experience considerably increased journey-time personal exposures to traffic-related air pollution. More effort is consequently needed to increase separation between road vehicles and pedestrians if negative effects of these policies are to be avoided.},

  abstract = {A global economic and financial crisis is engulfing the developing world, coming on top of high food and fuel prices. This paper assesses the impact of the crises on food consumption, nutrition, and health. Several methods were applied, including risk analysis using the cost of the food basket, assessment surveys, simulations, regression analysis using a food consumption score (FCS), reflecting diet frequency and diversity, and a review of the impact of such dietary changes on nutritional status and health. The cost of the food basket increased in several countries, forcing households to reduce quality and quantity of food consumed. The FCS, which is a measure of diet diversity, is negatively correlated with food prices. Simulations show that energy consumption declined during 2006-2010 in nearly all developing regions, resulting potentially in an additional 457 million people (of 4.5 billion) at risk of being hungry and many more unable to afford the dietary quality required to perform, develop, and grow well. As a result of the crises, large numbers of vulnerable households have reduced the quality and quantity of foods they consume and are at risk of increased malnutrition. Population groups most affected are those with the highest requirements, including young children, pregnant and lactating women, and the chronically ill (particularly people with HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis). Because undernutrition during the first 2 y of life has life-long consequences, even short-term price rises will have long-term effects. Thus, measures to mitigate the impact of the crises are urgently required.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in bicyclist and pedestrian route choice modeling have shown that a variety of attributes affect the paths chosen for cycling and walking. They also allow one to estimate the effect on route choice of specific network changes, such as new bicycle facilities or pedestrian crossings. Route choices do not, however, tell one anything explicit about changes in decisions to walk or cycle in the first place. Cyclists might go out of their way to use a bike lane or to avoid a busy street, but how do those same features along a potential route influence the choice to cycle instead of using another travel mode? Route choice models are applied to predict the cycling and walking routes considered for a given trip, and the resulting route-level attributes are used to predict trip mode choice. In general, existing route preferences do carry over to mode choice, but with important differences, especially for bicycle facility types and female cyclists. The results show that available off-street paths and low-traffic on-street routes not only draw cyclists from other facilities but also make prospective riders more likely to cycle on a given trip. Gender differences are found for decisions to bicycle, with women showing a lower propensity than men to cycle on a similar trip and also stronger sensitivity to the availability of routes with lower traffic stress. Traffic-calmed streets, such as bicycle boulevards, may be particularly important in reducing the observed bicycling gender gap for everyday travel.},

Trip purpose and several other trip-level variables recorded by the cyclists, and the resulting trips were coded to a highly detailed bicycle network. The authors used the 1449 non-exercise, utilitarian trips to estimate a bicycle route choice model. The model used a choice set generation algorithm based on multiple permutations of path attributes and was formulated to account for overlapping route alternatives. The findings suggest that cyclists are sensitive to the effects of distance, turn frequency, slope, intersection control (e.g. presence or absence of traffic signals), and traffic volumes. In addition, cyclists appear to place relatively high value on off-street bike paths, enhanced neighborhood bikeways with traffic calming features (aka " bicycle boulevards"), and bridge facilities. Bike lanes more or less exactly offset the negative effects of adjacent traffic, but were no more or less attractive than a basic low traffic volume street. Finally, route preferences differ between commute and other utilitarian trips; cyclists were more sensitive to distance and less sensitive to other infrastructure characteristics for commute trips. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this paper, we identify and investigate, in the Finnish context, the elements of the urban structure around homes and en route to school that promote children's ability to walk or cycle to school, using the conceptual domains proposed by Mitra (2013) to frame the work. The associations discovered can, to a large extent however, be viewed as contrasting significantly with those identified in previous research, as an increase in the variables, essentially indicating urbanity, decreased the likelihood of the children walking or cycling to school. This is due to the existence of a well-functioning public transportation network in the Helsinki region. The associations were more significantly associated with the environment en route to school than with the environment around homes. This research improves our understanding of active school transportation behaviour in an environment that is already relatively supportive of active transportation and independent mobility by offering a well-functioning public transportation system.},

This research investigates the opportunity to build up a PPGIS prototype with completely Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) architecture, in which data directly come from field surveys carried out by users. A sample application related to urban monitoring is addressed, which concentrates on user field-collected data concerning reports of road pavement damages. Open Data Kit suite allows users to collect geotagged multimedia information using mobile devices with onboard location sensors (e.g. a Global Positioning System receiver). On field-captured data are sent to a server and stored into a PostgreSQL database with PostGIS spatial extension. GeoServer then disseminates data on the Web. On the client-side, different solutions allow data visualization on both desktop computers and mobile devices. The designed architecture provided support for FOSS usage in the process of gathering, uploading, and Web publishing information collected in situ. The implementation of the developed PPGIS could thus substantially increase public active participation in data creation and sharing, besides enlarging DE knowledge up to the local level.},

There is little published information on the spatial accuracy of PPGIS data compared to expert-derived GIS data. This study assesses the spatial accuracy of PPGIS data collected for conservation planning in two regions of New Zealand in 2011 by comparing participant mapped locations of native vegetation with areas identified in the New Zealand Land Cover Database (LCDB) Version 2. Spatial error was operationalized as PPGIS locations having no native vegetation within 1000 m. The results indicate relatively low PPGIS spatial error of about 6\% compared to 22\% for randomly selected point locations in the regions. Spatial error is largest in coastal regions and near population centers where native vegetation is sparse and patchy. Participant familiarity with the study region is related to spatial error and is reflected in PPGIS sampling groups, with randomly sampled households having the largest error rate and the self-selected public, the lowest error rate. The results indicate a competitive, trade-off relationship between PPGIS participation rates and spatial accuracy. Future PPGIS research should identify processes with the capacity to increase both participation and spatial accuracy concurrently.},

To identify the key issues and research priorities in PPGIS, two researchers that have designed and implemented more than 40 empirical studies spanning both environmental and urban applications present their views about the present and future of PPGIS for land use planning and management. This paper is intended to be a synthesis, but not necessarily a consensus of the key issues and research priorities. We have organized the paper into six general key issues and four priority research topics. The key issues are: (1) conceptual and theoretical foundations, (2) the diversity of definitions and approaches to participatory mapping, (3) the spatial attributes measured in participatory mapping, (4) sampling, participation, and data quality, (5) relationships between participatory mapped attributes and physical places, and (6) the integration of PPGIS data into planning decision support. Our top research priorities include: (1) understanding and increasing participation rates, (2) identifying and controlling threats to spatial data quality, (3) improving the "PP" or public participation in PPGIS, and (4) evaluating the effectiveness of PPGIS. Our purpose for presenting a research agenda is to stimulate discourse among PPGIS researchers and practitioners about future research needs and to provide support for the mobilization of resources to undertake future empirical research. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Visitor perceptions of park experiences, environmental impacts, and facility needs were collected via an internet-based mapping method for input into a national park planning decision support system. The PPGIS method presupposes that consistent with the dominant statutory framework, national parks should be managed for both visitor enjoyment and natural and cultural resource protection. This paper: (1) describes the PPGIS method used in a 2009 park planning study conducted for national parks in the Greater Alpine region of Victoria, Australia; (2) presents and evaluates selected results of the Greater Alpine study and provides examples of how PPGIS data can be used for decision support in park planning; (3) provides a summary of lessons learned including a discussion of future implementation constraints. The results demonstrate that an internet, participatory mapping method, though not without limitations, can be effective in measuring visitor experiences, environmental impacts, and facility needs for a variety of park planning processes. PPGIS expands a park agency's repertoire of methods to engage the public in planning and can help build and sustain trust in a park agency's planning process and decisions.},

Specific research objectives were to examine the distribution of ecosystem services, identify the characteristics of participants in the study, explore potential relationships between ecosystem services and land use and land cover (LULC) classifications, and assess the methodological strengths and weakness of the PPGIS approach for identifying ecosystem services. Key findings include: (1) Cultural ecosystem service opportunities were easiest to identify while supporting and regulatory services most challenging, (2) participants were highly educated, knowledgeable about nature and science, and have a strong connection to the outdoors, (3) some LULC classifications were logically and spatially associated with ecosystem services, and (4) despite limitations, the PPGIS method demonstrates potential for identifying ecosystem services to augment expert judgment and to inform public or environmental policy decisions regarding land use trade-offs.},

Using an internet-based public participation geographic information system (PPGIS) system, study participants identified the spatial locations where they engaged in various types of physical activity and where they received other park benefits environmental, social, and psychological health benefits. Using an urban park typology, we found that different urban park types provide different opportunities for physical activity with linear parks providing the greatest overall physical benefit while other park types provided important non-physical community benefits. Distance to park was not a significant predictor of physical activity but park size was correlated with physical activity and other park benefits. We discuss the strengths and limitations of using PPGIS methods for understanding the benefits of urban park systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The purpose of this article is to show that the R2 values obtained in different studies are rarely comparable with each other and that a prediction model can be ``nearly perfect'' even if the coefficient of determination is small. Another purpose of the article is to present some results of interest from a practical viewpoint in regard to accidents where pedestrians and cyclists are involved. Empirical R2 values for models predicting accidents at junctions where pedestrians or cyclists are involved are compared with the maximal R2 values that could possibly be obtained. The latter can be calculated both theoretically and with the aid of simulation. How the maximal R2 value depends on the average accident level and the relative dispersion of the expected values for the studied junctions is also shown theoretically. The results obtained show how difficult it can be to determine whether and how far the number of accidents is influenced by additional factors, over and above the traffic flows, which describe the design in greater detail.},

In particular, it considers trends towards Big Data, and the impacts this is having on spatial data analysis and modelling. It identifies a turn in academia towards coding as a core analytic tool, and away from proprietary software tools offering `black boxes' where the internal workings of the analysis are not revealed. It is argued that this closed form software is problematic and considers a number of ways in which issues identified in spatial data analysis (such as the MAUP) could be overlooked when working with closed tools, leading to problems of interpretation and possibly inappropriate actions and policies based on these. In addition, this paper considers the role that reproducible and open spatial science may play in such an approach, taking into account the issues raised. It highlights the dangers of failing to account for the geographical properties of data, now that all data are spatial (they are collected somewhere), the problems of a desire for \$\$n\$\$n\,=\,all observations in data science and it identifies the need for a critical approach. This is one in which openness, transparency, sharing and reproducibility provide a mantra for defensible and robust spatial data science.},

  abstract = {In the past decade, substantial progress has been made in model-based optimization of sampling designs for mapping. This paper is an update of the overview of sampling designs for mapping presented by de Gruijter et al. (2006). For model-based estimation of values at unobserved points (mapping), probability sampling is not required, which opens up the possibility of optimized non-probability sampling. Non-probability sampling designs for mapping are regular grid sampling, spatial coverage sampling, k-means sampling, conditioned Latin hypercube sampling, response surface sampling, Kennard-Stone sampling and model-based sampling. In model-based sampling a preliminary model of the spatial variation of the soil variable of interest is used for optimizing the sample size and or the spatial coordinates of the sampling locations. Kriging requires knowledge of the variogram. Sampling designs for variogram estimation are nested sampling, independent random sampling of pairs of points, and model-based designs in which either the uncertainty about the variogram parameters, or the uncertainty about the kriging variance is minimized. Various minimization criteria have been proposed for designing a single sample that is suitable both for estimating the variogram and for mapping. For map validation, additional probability sampling is recommended, so that unbiased estimates of map quality indices and their standard errors can be obtained. For all sampling designs, R scripts are available in the supplement. Further research is recommended on sampling designs for mapping with machine learning techniques, designs that are robust against deviations of modeling assumptions, designs tailored at mapping multiple soil variables of interest and soil classes or fuzzy memberships, and probability sampling designs that are efficient both for design-based estimation of populations means and for model-based mapping.},

This question is policy relevant because distributional implications of mitigation policies may vary depending on the area of emissions that is targeted if specific types of households are likely to have higher emissions in some areas than in others. So far, this issue has not been examined in depth in the literature on household CO2 emissions. Using a representative UK expenditure survey, this paper compares how household characteristics like income, household size, education, gender, worklessness and rural or urban location differ in their association with all three areas as well as total emissions. We find that these associations vary considerably across emission domains. In particular, whilst all types of emissions rise with income, low income, workless and elderly households are more likely to have high emissions from home energy than from other domains, suggesting that they may be less affected by carbon taxes on transport or total emissions. This demonstrates that fairness implications related to mitigation policies need to be examined for separate emission domains.},

Stated and revealed-preference studies suggest a hierarchy of cyclist and non-cyclist preferences may exist, favoring separate paths and/or lanes over cycling on roadways with traffic \textemdash{} particularly with high volumes of fast-moving motorized traffic. Revealed- and stated-route-choice studies indicate that intersections have negative effects on the cycling experience, but that certain features can offset this. The research correlating link and node characteristics to cycling implies that networks of such facilities would have positive effects, though very few empirical studies link complex measures of the network to cycling levels. In spite of an increase in studies and general agreement among findings, several important research gaps remain, including empirical studies using comprehensive network measures and studies of specific facility designs and new types of facilities (including intersection treatments). Improved research methods are necessary, including better sampling, longitudinal studies, greater geographic diversity, and incorporating more control variables, including policies.},

In 2005, the share of population 65 years and older was 20\% in that country, a share predicted for the United States around 2030. Both countries have among the highest motorization rates in the world, and almost all adults are licensed drivers. A comparison of the United States and Germany can provide important lessons about determinants of travel behavior of the elderly. This study traced changes in travel behavior over time in both countries using German national travel surveys from 1982 and 2002 and U.S. national travel surveys from 1983 and 2001. The study then investigated differences in determinants of travel behavior between the two countries through a multiple regression analysis based on the 2002 German travel survey and the 2001 U.S. travel survey. In both countries all social groups but most markedly the elderly were found to be more mobile today than 20 years ago. In both countries, travel behavior of 45 to 64 year olds in the early 1980s was a good predictor of travel behavior of 65+ year olds in 2001. Once travel behavior is adopted, it seems to carry on into older age. Besides similar trends in each country, elderly Americans were found to make more trips by car than Germans. This difference held even when controlling for socioeconomic and demographic factors and spatial development patterns. Transportation policies can help explain this difference. Compared with the United States, policies in Germany make car use more expensive and particularly more difficult in cities. At the same time, public policies make cycling and public transportation easy to use, cheap, safe, convenient, and accessible transportation alternatives for a less car-dependent lifestyle into old age.},

We develop a Web 2.0 PPGIS application through free, easy-to-use tools, which consist of a Web mapping service, with eligible geospatial data layers, where users explore and comment. A database stores the contributions in a format supported by GIS. We also set up a prototype version in Canela (Brazil), to test its usability. The results showed that it is a valuable approach for engaging the public. It could promote communication among users and decision makers in a more interactive and straightforward way. Besides, it is easy to set up and understandable by non-experts. The Web 2.0 PPGIS may serve as a social tool for any spatially-related issue involving community members in any context.},

Design Population based, cross sectional study, using data on individual participants' diet and weight, and objective metrics of food environment exposure. Participants Working adults participating in the Fenland Study, Cambridgeshire, UK (n=5442, aged 29-62 years), who provided home and work addresses and commuting preferences. Takeaway food outlet exposure was derived using data from local authorities for individual environmental domains (at home, at work, and along commuting routes (the shortest route between home and work)), and for exposure in all three domains combined. Exposure was divided into quarters (Q); Q1 being the least exposed and Q4 being the most exposed. Main outcome measures Self reported consumption of takeaway type food (g/day; pizza, burgers, fried foods, and chips) using food frequency questionnaires, measured body mass index, and cut-offs for body mass index as defined by the World Health Organization. Results In multiple linear regression models, exposure to takeaway food outlets was positively associated with consumption of takeaway food. Among domains at home, at work, and along commuting routes, associations were strongest in work environments (Q4 v Q1; {$\beta$} coefficient=5.3 g/day, 95\% confidence interval 1.6 to 8.7; P{$<$}0.05), with evidence of a dose-response effect. Associations between exposure in all three domains combined and consumption were greater in magnitude across quarters of exposure (Q4 v Q1; 5.7 g/day, 2.6 to 8.8; P{$<$}0.001), with evidence of a dose-response effect. Combined exposure was especially strongly associated with increased body mass index (Q4 v Q1; body mass index 1.21, 0.68 to 1.74; P{$<$}0.001) and odds of obesity (Q4 v Q1; odds ratio 1.80, 1.28 to 2.53; P{$<$}0.05). There was no evidence of effect modification by sex. Conclusions Exposure to takeaway food outlets in home, work, and commuting environments combined was associated with marginally higher consumption of takeaway food, greater body mass index, and greater odds of obesity. Government strategies to promote healthier diets through planning restrictions for takeaway food could be most effective if focused around the workplace.},

  abstract = {The quality and supply of transport services closely relate to many environmental aspects and are among the main indicators showing the quality of life in cities. Urban sustainability is particular to each city, and this paper's research focuses on the energy consumption in Vilnius' private transport system and its dependency on land use as well as the mobility of its inhabitants. EMME/2 modeling software and the VIDAS transport database were employed to evaluate the relationship between the urban structure of Vilnius and energy consumption in private transport. The applied model was based on theoretical and practical considerations and provides clear and practical application possibilities in the analysis of different urban and transport infrastructures and their development strategies. A number of scenarios were performed in order to examine relations between land use and infrastructural changes and energy consumption. This work presents and supports the authors' hypothesis concerning the relationship between energy consumption in Vilnius' transport system and its urban structure. The research and future work based on the authors' findings for the development of Vilnius' bypasses and the reconstruction of current critical intersections showed a reduction in the current consumption of energy throughout Lithuania. However, the authors have found that in the long-term perspective, total fuel consumption will increase in the case of bypasses because longer (but faster) trips will predominate. Meanwhile, as evidence and research results shows, reconstruction of critical intersections will reduce the total fuel consumption and pollution in highly populated areas.},

  abstract = {This thesis explores the idea that while one-way streets are primarily meant to divert and control motor vehicle traffic, they should not limit the travel direction of bicyclists in a low-speed, low-volume context. With thoughtful design interventions, people riding bikes and driving cars can safely share space traveling in opposite directions \textendash{} even on streets that do not have space for dedicated contraflow bike lanes. An extensive European literature review, examination of six North American case studies, and video analysis from one street in Somerville, Massachusetts provide evidence that shared contraflow bike streets are a safe and useful street design for local roadways \textendash{} especially when needed for bicycle boulevards or neighborhood greenway routing. Video data collected before and after the opening of legal shared contraflow in Somerville reveal that ridership and safer positioning on the street increased, while sidewalk riding and close passing decreased. Additionally, this paper provides design guidance for different levels of shared contraflow interventions, recommends citywide contraflow policies rather than street-by-street application, and proposes public engagement and prioritization methods for studying, redesigning, and implementing shared contraflow bike streets. The project demonstrates how the absence of standards and guidance around these types of streets results in a lost opportunity for low-stress bike networks that serve people of all ages and abilities.},

The extent to which the requirements of the EIA Directive are met with respect to ecological issues has been explored in earlier reviews of road statements (Treweek et al., 1993) and of UK environmental impact statements (EISs) in general (Thompson et al., 1997). This paper describes the results of a further review of 40 EISs produced between 1993 and 1997 and also examines recent changes in the political context for EIA of proposed road developments,including developments in UK transport policy and the UK biodiversity process. The results of the review suggest that the ecological assessment of proposed road developments has improved in some respects, but also highlights the persistence of many shortcomings identified in earlier reviews. The reasons for ongoing failure to address these issues are explored. Key findings include a marked improvement in the extent of reference to consultation with statutory consultees and an increase in the proportion of EISs reporting the results of new ecological surveys. However, while potential ecological impacts were discussed in all the EISs reviewed, many still failed to predict the full range of potential ecological impacts.},

This has resulted in disparate health, employment, and education outcomes and created an additional impediment to achieving neighborhood wellness. Through a literature review and participant observation this article argues that bike equity should become a central tenet of urban sustainability, and discusses the limited empirical evidence of the best practices for promoting bicycling within marginalized communities.

In the past 10 years, there has been an extremely rapid growth, albeit from a very small base, of home delivery services for such shopping. As this sector has developed, there has been increasing concern about the growth in delivery traffic, countered by the hope that services are reducing personal car travel. The balance between such tendencies is critical to the overall impact of services. The present paper examines a range of international evidence, including the results of nine modelling assessments. The evidence suggests that with realistic levels of take-up, a direct substitution of car trips by van trips could reduce vehicle-km by 70\% or more. More complex shopper behavioural responses will occur, but, according to available empirical evidence, overall traffic reductions are still probable. Meanwhile, the benefits of services could be maximized by use of appropriate cost structures, new types of delivery location, less polluting vehicles, greater cooperation or out-sourcing by retailers, and measures to encourage greater consumption of local produce.},

The n best models and their support (e.g., (Q)AIC, (Q)AICc, or BIC) are returned, allowing model selection and multi-model inference through standard R functions. The package is optimized for large candidate sets by avoiding memory limitation, facilitating parallelization and providing, in addition to exhaustive screening, a compiled genetic algorithm method. This article briefly presents the statistical framework and introduces the package, with applications to simulated and real data.},

A selection of the initial set of uncertainty visualisations was further evaluated in a cognitive alternative task-switching experiment. The results show that graphical representations are able to convey uncertainty information relatively accurately, while some uncertainty visualisations outperform others. It depends on the model and scenario which representation is most suited for a given application. This paper presents an overview of possible graphic uncertainty representations and the considerations involved when applying them to uncertainty in traffic model visualisations.},

Yet the hype prompts questions. What is the rate of GIS diffusion? To what extent has the use of GIS really spread? How do you achieve effective implementation in practice? What are GIS used for? What is the relationship between GIS and organizations? In placing these questions at the heart of their book, Heather Campbell and Ian Masser set out to stimulate and contribute to the debate: despite their technologically innovative status, and the enormous growth in the aquisition of GIS technology by business and government (both local and central), very little is known about the actual impact these new technologies are having in practice. Using analyses derived from extensive surveys and case study investigations of local government experience, the authors explore the performance of GIS in practice on the premise that through enhanced understanding of the social and political processes which affect the relationship between organizations and technology individuals will be better able to influence their own destinies. In so doing the authors draw on experiences from organizational theory and management science in their quest to cast light on the processes influencing the implementation of technologies such as GIS.},

In the Netherlands, cost overruns are as common as cost underruns but because cost overruns are larger than cost underruns projects on average have a cost overrun of 16.5\%. The focus on one country further enabled to consider cost overruns during different project development phases. It turned out that in the Netherlands the majority of the cost overrun occurs in the pre-construction phase (the period between the formal decision to build and the start of construction). The frequency as well as the magnitude of pre-construction cost overrun is significantly higher than in the construction phase. The used methodology of calculating cost overruns does however not take lock-in into account. This phenomenon shows that the real decision to build was taken much earlier in the decision-making process. Since estimated costs are usually lower during these earlier stages, the cost overruns based on this real decision to build are likely to be much higher. Cost overruns presented in studies are therefore often underestimated and the problem of cost overruns is much larger than we think.},

This paper suggests a method of estimating origin/destination volumes, using a direct demand function and incomplete, aggregate data. Most attention is devoted to demand functions which are linear in their parameters. With such demand functions, volume estimates are obtained from a quadratic programming problem, which minimizes the sum of squared errors from a direct demand function, subject to constraints derived from observations of some travel volumes. A decomposition algorithm is suggested for solving the programming problem and is proven to converge. The method may also be used in the trip distribution phase of the conventional urban transportation model systems (UTMS).},

  abstract = {Economic and security motivations increasingly influence the formulation of climate change law and policy worldwide. The way in which notions of economic wellbeing and security are defined and incorporated into climate change law and policy raises fundamental concerns over both the internal and external equity of existing and evolving climate strategies. In particular, a key question that emerges is whether climate policies, based on economic and security considerations, promote more effective mitigation and adaptation strategies or whether they in fact encourage inward-looking, protectionist policies that impair long-term emissions abatement and disadvantage already vulnerable sectors of society. Economic and security concerns can be wielded for great good or great harm in the climate change debate. Drawing upon economic flexibility mechanisms and security-based measures to address climate change can facilitate global cooperation or it can perpetuate existing social, economic and environmental imbalances. The record of implementation thus far suggests that there is an urgent need to reassess the ability of economic flexibility mechanisms to promote long-term, equitable emissions reductions and to pre-emptively introduce equity considerations into the climate security debate. Melding climate change to economics and security makes domestic and international climate change initiatives more politically palatable and more responsive to the realities of global governance. The challenge is to find ways to wield economic and security concerns for the collective good. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {Road traffic noise is one of the most detrimental environmental nuisances for the population. Prolonged exposure to high road noise levels can lead to various problems in people's health and well-being. The objective of this article is to determine whether the groups most vulnerable to road noise, that is, children under 15 years old, people 65 years old and over, and the groups most likely to experience high nuisance levels, visible minorities and low-income individuals, are affected by an environmental inequity related to this nuisance. The method of estimating this nuisance employed in the study is based on a combination of several elements: that is, average traffic flows, road geometries, normal atmospheric conditions, and the characteristics of the urban environment. All of these parameters were considered for the 14 boroughs that make up the central portion of the Island of Montreal. Modelling was used to calculate the maximum daily road noise, based in part on the LimA software predictive model and according to the XPS 31-133 computation method. The results obtained from three different statistical tests and spatial regression analyses show that, on the one hand, the groups chosen on the basis of age are not affected by any environmental inequity related to the phenomenon of road traffic noise. On the other hand, low-income individuals and visible minorities live in city blocks marked by road traffic noise levels that are slightly higher than those experienced by the rest of the population.},

  abstract = {Much of the literature on social exclusion ignores its `spatial' or `mobility' related aspects. This paper seeks to rectify this by examining the mobile processes and infrastructures of travel and transport that engender and reinforce social exclusion in contemporary societies. To the extent to which this issue is addressed, it is mainly organized around the notion of `access' to activities, values and goods. This paper examines this discourse in some detail. It is argued that there are many dimensions of such access, that improving access is a complex matter because of the range of human activities that might need to be `accessed', that in order to know what is to be accessed the changing nature of travel and communications requires examination, and that some dimensions of access are only revealed through changes in the infrastructure that `uncover' previously hidden social exclusions. Claims about access and socio-spatial exclusion routinely make assumptions about what it is to participate effectively in society. We turn this question around, also asking how mobilities of different forms constitute societal values and sets of relations, participation in which may become important for social inclusion. This paper draws upon an extensive range of library, desk and field research to deal with crucial issues relating to the nature of a fair, just and mobile society.},

  abstract = {Engagement in walking for recreation can contribute to healthy aging. Although there is growing evidence that the neighborhood environment can influence walking for recreation, the amount of such evidence in relation to older adults is scarce and limited to Western low-density urban locations. Asian urban environments are typified by distinctive environmental and cultural characteristics that may yield different patterns to those observed in Western countries. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to examine associations of perceived environmental attributes with overall and within-neighborhood walking for recreation in Chinese elders (65+ years) residing in Hong Kong, an ultradense Asian metropolis. A sample of 484 elders was recruited from 32 neighborhoods stratified by socio-economic status and walkability (dwelling and intersection densities). Validated questionnaires measuring perceived neighborhood environment and weekly minutes of overall and within-neighborhood walking for recreation were interviewer administered. Results showed that the level of recreational walking was twice to four times higher than that reported in Western adults and elders. While overall walking for recreation showed a general lack of associations with perceived environmental attributes, within-neighborhood recreational walking was positively related with proximity of recreational facilities, infrastructure for walking, indoor places for walking, and presence of bridge/overpasses connecting to services. Age and educational attainment moderated the associations with several perceived environmental attributes with older and less-educated participants showing stronger associations. Traditional cultural views on the benefits of physical activity and the high accessibility of facilities and pedestrian infrastructure of Hong Kong may explain the high levels of walking. Although specific neighborhood attributes, or their perception, may influence recreational walking within the neighborhood, the compactness and public transport affordability of ultradense metropolises such as Hong Kong may make it easy for elders to compensate for the lack of favorable neighborhood attributes by walking outside the neighborhood.},

  abstract = {Bogot\'a, Colombia, is well known for its sustainable urban transport systems, including an extensive network of bike lanes and set-aside street space for recreational cyclists and pedestrians on Sundays and holidays, called Ciclov\'ia (``cycleway''). This paper examines how such facilities along with other attributes of the built environment\textemdash urban densities, land-use mixes, accessibility, and proximity to transit\textemdash are associated with walking and cycling behavior as well as Ciclov\'ia participation. We find that whereas road facility designs, like street density, connectivity, and proximity to Ciclov\'ia lanes, are associated with physical activity, other attributes of the built environment, like density and land-use mixtures, are not. This is likely because most neighborhoods in built-up sections of Bogot\'a evolved during a time when non-automobile travel reigned supreme, meaning they are uniformly compact, mixed in their land-use composition, and have comparable levels of transport accessibility. Thus facility designs are what sway nonmotorized travel, not generic land-use attributes of neighborhoods.},

Existing literature highlights the importance of built environments, urban amenities, and high-quality bicycle networks in promoting cycling. However, few studies measure the respective contributions and weigh the collective magnitude of effects of these influences together. We present a multivariate model that reflects the influences of such factors for 36 cities and towns in Britain. The models reveal a complex web of forces shaping cycling to work, confirming that there is no single, silver-bullet factor even in cities with remarkably high commuter cycling. The model results highlight the importance in joining up network level interventions, for instance to reduce both route circuity and on-road stress, which are objectives often being pursued separately. The results also highlight the importance of non-transport aspects such as land use mix and landscape amenities along commuter routes, and the role of city-specific cycling culture. They also underscore the need for closer collaboration between promoters of commuter cycling and wider urban disciplines to create low-stress routes and supportive built environments in cities and their outskirts.},

  abstract = {The built environment is thought to influence travel demand along three principal dimensions \textemdash density, diversity, and design. This paper tests this proposition by examining how the `3Ds' affect trip rates and mode choice of residents in the San Francisco Bay Area. Using 1990 travel diary data and land-use records obtained from the U.S. census, regional inventories, and field surveys, models are estimated that relate features of the built environment to variations in vehicle miles traveled per household and mode choice, mainly for non-work trips. Factor analysis is used to linearly combine variables into the density and design dimensions of the built environment. The research finds that density, land-use diversity, and pedestrian-oriented designs generally reduce trip rates and encourage non-auto travel in statistically significant ways, though their influences appear to be fairly marginal. Elasticities between variables and factors that capture the 3Ds and various measures of travel demand are generally in the 0.06 to 0.18 range, expressed in absolute terms. Compact development was found to exert the strongest influence on personal business trips. Within-neighborhood retail shops, on the other hand, were most strongly associated with mode choice for work trips. And while a factor capturing `walking quality' was only moderately related to mode choice for non-work trips, those living in neighborhoods with grid-iron street designs and restricted commercial parking were nonetheless found to average significantly less vehicle miles of travel and rely less on single-occupant vehicles for non-work trips. Overall, this research shows that the elasticities between each dimension of the built environment and travel demand are modest to moderate, though certainly not inconsequential. Thus it supports the contention of new urbanists and others that creating more compact, diverse, and pedestrian-orientated neighborhoods, in combination, can meaningfully influence how Americans travel.},

Several emerging markets, including India and China, the most populous countries in the world, are currently at the stage of development when such takeoff is expected to take place. We project that the number of cars will increase by 2.3 billion between 2005 and 2050, with an increase by 1.9 billion in emerging market and developing countries. We outline a number of possible policy options to deal with the implications for the countries affected and the world as a whole. \textemdash{} Marcos Chamon, Paolo Mauro and Yohei Okawa},

  abstract = {Urbanization nowadays results in the most dynamic and drastic changes in land use/land cover, with a significant impact on the environment. A detailed analysis and assessment of this process is necessary to take informed actions to reduce its impact on the environment and human well-being. In most parts of the world, detailed information on the composition, structure, extent, and temporal changes of urban areas is lacking. The purpose of this study is to present a methodology to produce high-resolution land use/land cover maps by the use of free software and satellite imagery. These maps can help to understand dynamic urbanizations processes to plan, design, and coordinate sustainable urban development plans, especially in areas with limited resources and advancing environmental degradation. A series of high-resolution true color images provided by Google Earth Pro were used to do initial classifications with the Semi-Automatic Classification Plug-in in QGIS. Afterwards, a new methodology to improve the classification by the elimination of shadows and clouds, and a reduction of misclassifications through superimposition was applied. The classification was carried out for three urban areas in Le\&oacute;n, Nicaragua, with different degrees of urbanization for the years 2009, 2015, and 2018. Finally, the accuracy of the classification was analyzed using randomly defined validation polygons. The results are three sets of high-resolution land use/land cover maps of the initial and the improved classification, showing the detailed structures and temporal dynamics of urbanization. The average accuracy of classification reaches 74\%, but up to 85\% for the best classification. The results clearly identify advancing urbanization, the loss of vegetation and riparian zones, and threats to urban ecosystems. In general, the level of detail and simplicity of our methodology is a valuable tool to support sustainable urban management, although its application is not limited to these areas and can also be employed to track changes over time, providing therefore, relevant information to a wide range of decision-makers.},

This paper presents findings from in-depth interviews that sought to understand the circumstances and factors that influenced people to start, stop or significantly change their amount of cycling. The interviews were held with residents of 12 towns and cities in England that were experiencing an unprecedented scale of investment in cycling by UK standards. The interviews collected biographical information on travel behaviour life circumstances and probed the reasons for changes in cycling. Theory and preliminary analysis were used to develop a conceptual model which posits that turning points in cycling behaviour are triggered by contextual change and mediated by intrinsic motivations, facilitating conditions and personal history. It is shown that life events were usually the trigger for a change in cycling but external changes to the bicycle environment played a facilitating role in enabling change. The types of life events that were relevant varied over the age span of participants. Practitioners can take advantage of the life events identified as opportunities to promote cycling.},

Building on earlier work that focussed on variations in financial impacts of motoring based on median income for areas, this analysis extends the research in two main ways. Firstly through the use of UK Office for National Statistics' ``area classifications'' which allow variation in expenditure (and expenditure as a proportion of income) to be analysed in terms of eight different social profiles. Secondly, using UK Census Travel to Work data, we calculated an indicator that reflects the proportion of annual mileage driven by households in an area that is comprised of travel to and from work by car. The results indicate that use of the car and the financial implications vary between different social areas, but there tends to be a negative relationship between the proportion of income spent on motoring and the proportion of mileage used for commuting (i.e. those areas that use their cars most for driving to work, actually spend less of their income on fuel costs).},

However, the amount of energy used by households varies greatly, with some using considerably more than others and, therefore, potentially being able to make a bigger contribution towards overall reductions. Using two recently released UK datasets based on combined readings from over 70 million domestic energy meters and vehicle odometers, we present exploratory analyses of patterns of direct household energy usage. Whilst much energy justice work has previously focussed on energy vulnerability, mainly in low consumers, our findings suggest that a minority of areas appear to be placing much greater strain on energy networks and environmental systems than they need. Households in these areas are not only the most likely to be able to afford energy efficiency measures to reduce their impacts, but are also found to have other capabilities that would allow them to take action to reduce consumption (such as higher levels of income, education and particular configurations of housing type and tenure). We argue that these areas should therefore be a higher priority in the targeting of policy interventions.},

Frequent traffic congestion has caused the society to suffer efficiency loss in terms of idle time on the road. The promotion of public transport by the government has yet to produce satisfactory results in terms of inducing a significant switch in mode of transport. Thus, this paper intends to study the factors that are related to the choice of mode of transport, particularly in Penang, the second most densely populated state in Malaysia. The limited inhabitable space of this small island state poses an urgent need to discourage the growing use of private vehicle by its residents. The findings of this study aims to provide a better understanding of the determinants of mode choice behavior of road users in Penang and allow for policy makers to formulate a more effective public transport policy in the future.},

The methodology involves the use of Bayesian hierarchical intrinsic conditional autoregressive model, which accounts for unobserved heterogeneities and spatial autocorrelations. The city of Seattle is selected for this empirical study, and the geospatial unit of analysis is traffic analysis zone. The primary data were obtained from collision profiles available at the Seattle Department of Transportation. The major findings of this study include: (1) the densities of 4-way intersections and more than 5-way intersections and land use mixture are positively correlated with the pedestrian crash frequency and risk; (2) sidewalk density and the proportion of steep areas are negatively associated with the pedestrian crash frequency and risk; (3) areas with a higher bus stop density are likely to have more pedestrian crashes; (4) areas with a greater proportion of industrial land use have lower pedestrian crash frequency; (5) areas with an averagely higher posted speed limit has higher pedestrian crash risk; (6) areas with a higher employment density has lower pedestrian crash risk; (7) the mode share of walking and the total number of trips are positively correlated with the pedestrian crash frequency, and the total number of trips is negatively correlated with the pedestrian crash risk. These findings provide support for planning policy-making and road safety programs. Local authorities should improve walkability by providing more sidewalks and separate travel lanes for motorized traffic and pedestrians in areas with different land use purposes. Compact development should be encouraged to support building a safe walking environment.},

However, whether these benefits are distributed throughout society in a fair manner is still an open question. This study presents a methodological framework for assessing the equity performance of bike-sharing systems, with Coast Bike Share system in southern Tampa as a case study. The framework integrates three different datasets: bike-sharing infrastructure, individual travel itineraries and individual sociodemographic attribute data. With these datasets, we model individual accessibility to activity locations using bike-sharing as the mode of transportation by analyzing the ``walking-cycling-walking'' process of a bike-sharing trip and the trip-chaining behavior in individuals' travel itineraries. Further, a series of equity measures are used to analyze equity performance from the perspective of both horizontal and vertical equity. To assess horizontal equity, we apply the Lorenz curve, Gini index and mapped geographic differences. For vertical equity, we compare descriptive statistics by group, perform analysis of variance, and calculate the subgroup inequality index using disaggregated data. Results reveal that accessibility to bike-sharing is not evenly distributed among individuals in the population, within the geographic space, and among different sociodemographic groups of southern Tampa. Further, our results also highlight the need to incorporate high-resolution disaggregated data and tour-based analysis to address the equity performance of bike-sharing systems.},

It does so both in analytical and empirical terms mov- ing from a wider supranational and analytical standpoint to a more practical and local one. The impact of territorial competition in welfare terms de- pends critically on the perspective adopted. Some policies are pure waste even from the point of view of the initiating territory. Other policies may have a positive impact in economic welfare terms, viewed from the per- spective of the territory, but be zero sum from a wider perspective. There may also be policies, however, which increase economic welfare, both lo- cally and from a wider perspective. This suggests that there is a case for providing a supranational regulatory framework. The empirical section first examines the evidence as to whether local policies for economic growth do, in fact, have any impact. The paper concludes with an examination of the actual policies pursued in a sample of European regions and draws out some conclusions for local policy makers.},

Even though CDW recycling reduces the demand for virgin materials and landfill space, several studies have concluded that the energy footprint of CDW recycling can be signif- icant. Previous studies have found that the amount of energy needed to recycle CDW is driven by many factors, including regional recycling capabilities, distances from construction sites to recycling facilities, and the types of recycling facilities. The purpose of this article is to present a transportation energy accounting method, using material flow analysis, whereby designers and contractors can (1) reliably and easily estimate the transportation energy use at the design and construction stages, and (2) reduce the number of assumptions and thereby improve the reliability of the models.},

  abstract = {Objective: Built environment characteristics are closely related to transport behavior, but observed variations could be due to residents own choice of neighborhood called residential self-selection. The aim of this study was to investigate differences in neighborhood walkability and residential self-selection across life stages in relation to active transport behavior. Methods: The IPEN walkability index, which consists of four built environment characteristics, was used to define 16 high and low walkable neighborhoods in Aarhus, Denmark (250.000 inhabitants). Transport behavior was assessed using the IPAQ questionnaire. Life stages were categorized in three groups according to age and parental status. A factor analysis was conducted to investigate patterns of selfselection. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were carried out to evaluate the association between walkability and transport behavior i.e. walking, cycling and motorized transport adjusted for residential self-selection and life stages. Results: A total of 642 adults aged 20\textendash 65 years completed the questionnaire. The highest rated selfselection preference across all groups was a safe and secure neighborhood followed by getting around easily on foot and by bicycle. Three self-selection factors were detected, and varied across the life stages. In the multivariable models high neighborhood walkability was associated with less motorized transport (OR 0.33 95\% CI 0.18\textendash 0.58), more walking (OR 1.65 95\% CI 1.03\textendash 2.65) and cycling (OR 1.50 95\% CI 1.01\textendash 2.23). Self-selection and life stage were also associated with transport behavior, and attenuated the association with walkability. Conclusion: This study supports the hypothesis that some variation in transport behavior can be explained by life stages and self-selection, but the association between living in a more walkable neighborhood and active transport is still significant after adjusting for these factors. Life stage significantly moderated the association between neighborhood walkability and cycling for transport, and household income significantly moderated the association between neighborhood walkability and walking for transport. Getting around easily by bicycle and on foot was the highest rated self-selection factor second only to perceived neighborhood safety.},

  abstract = {Public bicycle and car sharing schemes have proliferated in recent years and are increasingly part of the urban transport landscape. Shared transport options have the potential to support social inclusion by improving accessibility: these initiatives could remove some of the barriers to car ownership or bicycle usage such as upfront costs, maintenance and storage. However, the existing evidence base indicates that, in reality, users are most likely to be white, male and middle class. This paper argues that there is a need to consider the social inclusivity of sharing schemes and to develop appropriate evaluation frameworks accordingly. We therefore open by considering ways in which shared transport schemes might be inclusive or not, using a framework developed from accessibility planning. In the second part of the paper, we use the case study of Glasgow in Scotland to undertake a spatial equity analysis of such schemes. We examine how well they serve different population groups across the city, using the locations of bicycle stations and car club parking spaces in Glasgow, comparing and contrasting bike and car. An apparent failure to deliver benefits across the demographic spectrum raises important questions about the socially inclusive nature of public investment in similar schemes.},

  abstract = {Recent longitudinal studies of household car ownership have examined factors associated with increases and decreases in car ownership level. The contribution of this panel data analysis is to identify the predictors of different types of car ownership level change (zero to one car, one to two cars and vice versa) and demonstrate that these are quite different in nature. The study develops a large scale data set (n = 19,334), drawing on the first two waves (2009\textendash 2011) of the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS). This has enabled the generation of a comprehensive set of life event and spatial context variables. Changes to composition of households (people arriving and leaving) and to driving licence availability are the strongest predictors of car ownership level changes, followed by employment status and income changes. Households were found to be more likely to relinquish cars in association with an income reduction than they were to acquire cars in association with an income gain. This may be attributed to the economic recession of the time. The effect of having children differs according to car ownership state with it increasing the probability of acquiring a car for non-car owners and increasing the probability of relinquishing a car for two car owners. Sensitivity to spatial context is demonstrated by poorer access to public transport predicting higher probability of a non-car owning household acquiring a car and lower probability of a one-car owning household relinquishing a car. While previous panel studies have had to rely on comparatively small samples, the large scale nature of the UKHLS has provided robust and comprehensive evidence of the factors that determine different car ownership level changes.},

  abstract = {This article explores the stability of local vehicle ownership rates in Great Britain using the technique of spatial Markov chain analysis. Non-spatial Markov chain processes describe the transition of neighbourhoods through levels of ownership with no regard to their neighbourhood context. In reality however, how a neighbourhood transitions to different levels of ownership could be influenced by its neighbourhood context. A spatial Markov chain accounts for this context by estimating transition properties that are conditioned on the surrounding neighbourhood. These spatial Markov chain properties are estimated using a long run census time series from 1971 to 2011 of household vehicle ownership rates in Great Britain. These processes show that there is different behaviour in how neighbourhoods transition between levels of ownership depending on the context of their surrounding neighbours. The general finding is that the spatial Markov process will lead to a greater homogeneity in levels of ownership in each locality, with neighbourhoods surrounded by relatively low ownership neighbourhoods taking longer than a non-spatial Markov process would suggest to transition to higher levels, whilst neighbourhoods of high ownership surrounded by high ownership neighbourhoods take longer to transition to lower levels. This work corroborates Tobler's first law of geography ``Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things'' but also provides practical guidance. Firstly, in modelling ownership, spatial effects need to be tested and when present, accounted for in the model formulation. Secondly, in a policy context, the surrounding neighbourhood situation is important, with neighbourhoods having a tendency towards homogeneity of ownership levels. This allows for the effective planning of transport provision for local services. Thirdly, vehicle ownership is often used as a proxy for the social and aspirational nature of an area and these results suggest that these properties will persist for a prolonged period, possibly perpetuating and exacerbating differentials in society.},

The system is used to recapture the energy lost in vehicle braking, significantly reducing a vehicle's overall energy consumption and lowering vehicle emissions.

(2) Young drivers have the great majority of their accidents by losing control on bends or curves, typically at night in rural areas and/or while driving for 'leisure' purposes. These accidents show high levels of speeding, alcohol involvement and recklessness. (3) Older drivers had fewer accidents, but those fatalities they were involved in tended to involve misjudgement and perceptual errors in 'right of way' collisions, typically in the daytime on rural rather than urban roads. Blameworthy right of way errors were notably high for drivers aged over 65 years, as a proportion of total fatal accidents in that age group.},

  abstract = {A rivers' longitudinal gradient (i.e. slope) is a key parameter in fluvial hydrology, hydraulics, and geomorphology. It affects a multitude of fluvial variables such as flow velocity and sediment transport. Limitations in river slope data, both its availability and accuracy, constrain the fidelity of fluvial modeling, particularly at larger or global scales. Traditional slope calculation algorithms cannot accurately predict river slopes as these are based on cell-by-cell calculation, which is only suitable for hillslopes and small mountainous streams. This paper presents a methodology for calculating global river slope and a procedure to upscale it for relatively coarse resolution, suitable for global scale modeling. The methodology is based on a simple principle of calculating slope from elevation depression over the length of a river segment, which is automated to allow global scale calculations. Version 1.0 of the Global River-Slope (GloRS) geospatial dataset is introduced and shown to be a step improvement over a previous product (NHDplus for the contiguous United States) and compares favorably to observed slope data collected from the literature. Statistical analysis of Earth's continents and large basins highlights interesting spatial trends. A semi-empirical regression analysis between basin-average river slope and other basin-scale parameters show that terrain slope accounts for 67\% of the variability in basin-average river slope, with average discharge, sediment load and basin temperature contributing additional improvements to global predictions of 3\%, 4\%, and 3\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {Empirically analyzing empirical evidence One of the central goals in any scientific endeavor is to understand causality. Experiments that seek to demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor. Aarts et al. describe the replication of 100 experiments reported in papers published in 2008 in three high-ranking psychology journals. Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study. Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aac4716 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTION Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error. RATIONALE There is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science. RESULTS We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (Mr = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (Mr = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P {$<$} .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams. CONCLUSION No single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here. Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that ``we already know this'' belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know.

Analogical reasoning requires an understanding of both sciences and an appreciation of the similarities and points of contact between the two. In the current ecological literature on the relationship between ecology and physics, there has been some misunderstanding about the nature of modern physics and its methods. Physics is seen as being much cleaner and tidier than ecology. When compared to this idealized, fictional version of physics, ecology looks very different, and the prospect of ecology and physics learning from one another is questionable. We argue that physics, once properly understood, is more like ecology than ecologists have thus far appreciated. Physicists and ecologists can and do learn from each other, and, in this paper, we outline how analogical reasoning can facilitate such exchanges.},

Since its first release in 2004, SAGA has rapidly developed from a specialized tool for digital terrain analysis to a comprehensive and globally established GIS platform for scientific analysis and modeling. SAGA is coded in C++ in an object oriented design and runs under several operating systems including Windows and Linux. Key functional features of the modular software architecture comprise an application programming interface for the development and implementation of new geoscientific methods, a user friendly graphical user interface with many visualization options, a command line interpreter, and interfaces to interpreted languages like R and Python. The current version 2.1.4 offers more than 600 tools, which are implemented in dynamically loadable libraries or shared objects and represent the broad scopes of SAGA in numerous fields of geoscientific endeavor and beyond. In this paper, we inform about the system's architecture, functionality, and its current state of development and implementation. Furthermore, we highlight the wide spectrum of scientific applications of SAGA in a review of published studies, with special emphasis on the core application areas digital terrain analysis, geomorphology, soil science, climatology and meteorology, as well as remote sensing.},

  abstract = {Most analyses of accessibility by public transit have focused on travel time and not considered the cost of transit fares. It is difficult to include fares in shortest-path algorithms because fares are often path-dependent. When fare policies allow discounted transfers, for example, the fare for a given journey segment depends on characteristics of previous journey segments. Existing methods to characterize tradeoffs between travel time and monetary cost objectives do not scale well to complex networks, or they rely on approximations. Additionally, they often require assumed values of time, which may be problematic for evaluating the equity of service provision. We propose a new method that allows us to find Pareto sets of paths, jointly minimizing fare and travel time. Using a case study in greater Boston, Massachusetts, USA, we test the algorithm's performance as part of an interactive web application for computing accessibility metrics. Potential extensions for journey planning and route choice models are also discussed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Walking to school is associated with higher levels of physical activity, but the contribution of the journey itself to physical activity before school is unknown. PURPOSE: This study combined accelerometer and GPS data to investigate the level and location of physical activity in children walking to school. METHODS: Participants were 137 children (aged 11.3 + or - 0.3 years) from London, England, measured in June-July 2006. Physical activity was measured by accelerometry, and location was determined with a GPS receiver. Travel mode was self-reported. Accelerometer and GPS data were time-matched to provide activity level and location for each 10-second epoch where both were available. Journeys were mapped in a GIS. RESULTS: Mean accelerometer counts per minute before school (8:00 am to 9:00 am) were 43\% higher in those who walked to school than those traveling by car (878.8 + or - 387.6 vs 608.7 + or - 264.1 counts per minute [cpm], p{$<$}0.001). Eleven percent (4.5 minutes) of daily moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) occurred in this hour, with walkers recording 2.1 minutes more than car travelers (p = 0.004). Children followed direct routes between home and the school playground. Total activity during the walk to school was twice that in the playground (2131.3 + or - 1170.7 vs 1089.7 + or - 938.6 cpm, p{$<$}0.001), with the journey contributing three times as much MVPA as time in the playground. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence that the journey to school is purposeful and contributes to higher total physical activity and MVPA in children. Combining accelerometer and GPS data may aid our understanding of the environmental context of physical activity.},

We improve on this approach with a methodology for combining multiple betweenness computations using cross-validated ridge regression to create wide-scale, high-resolution transport models. This enables computationally efficient calibration of distance decay, agglomeration effects, and multiple trip purposes. Together with minimization of the Geoffrey E. Havers (GEH) statistic commonly used to evaluate transport models, this bridges a gap between SpNA and mainstream transport modeling practice. The methodology is demonstrated using models of bicycle transport, where the higher resolution of the SpNA models compared to mainstream (four-step) models is of particular use. Additional models are developed incorporating heterogeneous user preferences (cyclist aversion to motor traffic). Based on network shape and flow data alone the best model gives reasonable correlation against cyclist flows on individual links, weighted to optimize GEH (r2 = 0.78, GEH = 1.9). As SpNA models use a single step rather than four, and can be based on flow data alone rather than demographics and surveys, the cost of calibration is lower, ensuring suitability for small-scale infrastructure projects as well as large-scale studies.},

It computes measures of accessibility (reach, mean distance/closeness centrality, gravity), flows (bidirectional betweenness centrality) and efficiency (circuity) as well as convex hull properties, localised within lower- and upper-bounded radial bands. Weighting is flexible and can make use of geometric properties, data attached to links, zones, matrices or combinations of the above. Motivated by a desire to base network analysis on route choice and spatial cognition, the definition of distance can be network-Euclidean, angular, a mixture of both, custom, or specific to cyclists (avoiding slope and motorised traffic). In addition to statistics on network links, the following outputs can be computed: geodesics, network buffers, accessibility maps, convex hulls, flow bundles and skim matrices. Further tools assist with network preparation and calibration of network models to observed data. To date, sDNA has been used mainly for urban network analysis both by academics and city planners/engineers, for tasks including prediction of pedestrian, cyclist, vehicle and metro flows and mode choice; also quantification of the built environment for epidemiology and urban planning \& design.},

  abstract = {Closeness and betweenness are forms of spatial network analysis grounded in a long-standing tradition of measuring accessibility and flow potential. More recently, these measures have been enhanced by the concept of spatial localization, producing effective models for the prediction of pedestrian and vehicle driver behaviour.A contradiction arises where the distance metric used to define locality does not match the distance metric used to define shortest paths for closeness and betweenness. A typical case is the use of angular shortest paths within a Euclidean buffer as a pedestrian flow model. Such a model assumes that people make a mode choice based on distance, but a route choice based on least angular change \textendash{} even when this results in an excessively long `problem route', which conflicts with their criterion for mode choice.This study examines the prevalence of problem routes and the magnitude of their effect on some pedestrian and vehicle models. We show that while in a weighted analysis, pathological cases could invalidate an entire model, in the models presented the effect of this contradiction is minor. We do this by comparing model predictions to real flow data, using four strategies for handling problem routes: ignore, discard, reroute and strict locality. Strict locality is justified on the grounds of bounded rationality. We find all strategies to give broadly similar results, although the reroute and strict strategies give marginally better simulation accuracy. We also present a discussion of the characteristics of each strategy, and findings on computational efficiency.We conclude that it is prudent in any computation of localized closeness and betweenness to consider the impact of problem routes; however, they do not necessarily invalidate these forms of analysis, which remain useful.},

This study is a longitudinal investigation of before and after urban environmental change in a town centre and its association with vitality. The case study baseline is Cardiff town centre in 2007, prior and after major changes instigated by re-configuring Cardiff public and quasi-public street layout due to implementation of the St David's Phase 2 retail development. We present a Multivariate Hybrid Spatial Network Analysis (MHSpNA) model, which bridges the gap between existing Spatial Network Analysis models and four stage modelling techniques. Multiple theoretical flows are computed based on retail floor area (everywhere to shops, shop to shop, stations to shops and parking to shops). The calibration process determines a suitable balance of these to best match observed pedestrian flows, using generalized cross-validation to prevent overfit. Validation shows that the 2007 model successfully predicts vitality as pedestrian flows measured in 2010 and 2011. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that a vitality-pedestrian flow model has been evaluated for its ability to forecast town centre vitality changes over time.},

The article offers, and justifies, two working definitions of empowerment, differentiating between empowerment and empowerment capacity. It proposes a framework to structure an analysis of empowerment. The framework combines four catalysts of empowerment (information, process, skills, and tools) with two social scales (individuals and community).},

This region (Amazonia) is also estimated to contain about one-tenth of the total carbon stored in land ecosystems, and to account for one-tenth of global, net primary productivity. The resilience of the forest to the combined pressures of deforestation and global warming is therefore of great concern, especially as some general circulation models (GCMs) predict a severe drying of Amazonia in the twenty-first century. Here we analyse these climate projections with reference to the 2005 drought in western Amazonia, which was associated with unusually warm North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SSTs). We show that reduction of dry-season (July-October) rainfall in western Amazonia correlates well with an index of the north-south SST gradient across the equatorial Atlantic (the 'Atlantic N-S gradient'). Our climate model is unusual among current GCMs in that it is able to reproduce this relationship and also the observed twentieth-century multidecadal variability in the Atlantic N-S gradient, provided that the effects of aerosols are included in the model. Simulations for the twenty-first century using the same model show a strong tendency for the SST conditions associated with the 2005 drought to become much more common, owing to continuing reductions in reflective aerosol pollution in the Northern Hemisphere.},

These studies also suggest that the association between income inequality and health is country-specific. Unresolved methodological issues include the geographical level at which to model the effects of income inequality, and the appropriate statistical methods to use. This study compares the results of single-level and multi-level logistic regression models estimating the association between income inequality and self-assessed health in local authorities in Scotland. The results suggest that there is a significant positive association between income inequality and health across local authorities in Scotland, even after adjusting for individual-level socio-economic status. They also suggest that there is significant local authority-level variation in self-assessed health, but this is small compared to the variation at the individual level. Income and other measures of individuals' socio-economic status are more strongly associated with self-assessed health than income inequality. This study provides further evidence that the income inequality:health association is place-specific. It also suggests that methodological choices regarding the ways of estimating the association between self-assessed health, individual-level socio-economic status and area-level income inequality may not make a substantive difference to the results when contextual effects are small. Further work is required to test the sensitivity of these conclusions to alternative levels of geographical aggregation. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Measures of temperature (as proxies for climate) have frequently been employed in empirical work regarding the determinants of population migration decisions. A wide range of such specifications have been used, most of which imply restrictions on the preferences of migrants. In this paper, a variety of temperature variable specifications are analyzed and interpreted. Statistical tests for nested and nonnested hypotheses are used to compare and choose among the various specifications."

  abstract = {For over 50 years, hazards researchers have focused on a series of fundamental questions: 1) what is the human occupancy of hazard zones? 2) How do people and societies respond to environmental hazards and what factors influence their choice or adjustments? 3) How do you mitigate the risk and impact of environmental hazards? Within the last decade or so, another question was added to our ongoing list of imponderables: are societies becoming more vulnerable to environmental hazards?{$<$}p{$>$}Vulnerability, broadly defined as the potential for loss, is an essential concept in hazards research and is central to the development of hazard mitigation strategies at the local, national and international level. Within the framework of the UN's International Decade of Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR), for example, vulnerability assessments are used to determine the potential damage and loss of life from extreme natural events. They are important as well in proposing hazard reduction alternatives where mitigation normally takes the form of structural (engineered) approaches to hazard reduction (Coburn and Spence, 1992; Clayton, 1994). Rarely mentioned are the underlying causes of increased social vulnerability to hazards or disaster events. Yet, vulnerability now forms the cornerstone of international efforts aimed at reversing the poverty, population, development and environmental degradation downwards spiral. This development-based approach to vulnerability reduction is best seen in Cuny's (1983) classic work on Disasters and development. Despite these noteworthy efforts, we still lack a common conceptualization of vulnerability.{$<$}p{$>$}This progress report reviews the recent research on vunerability in the hazards field. This critical evaluation focuses on three thematic areas: the confusion and contradiction on the meaning of the term; measurement; and the causes of spatial outcomes associated with vulnerability studies. A new conceptual model of vulnerability is then proposed, the hazard of place, which clarifies many of the discrepancies found in the existing literature.},

In Sydney, Australia, people walk farther to the train than to the bus, the distributions of walking distances are different for each mode, and the trip and demographic characteristics of train and bus users are different. Given the decision to walk to public transport, demographic characteristics such as age, gender, income, and labor force status and trip characteristics such as trip purpose, time of day and week, fare and ticket type, and trip duration are not significant in explaining walking distance to each mode of public transport. The mode of the public transport trip is the most important determinant of walking distance, reflecting the different supply and spacing of each mode. For instance, there are many more bus stops than train stations. The differences between train and bus users suggest that accessibility initiatives for public transport might not be the same for each mode.},

  abstract = {While segregation is usually evaluated at the residential level, the recent influx of large streams of data describing urbanites' movement across the city allows to generate detailed descriptions of spatio-temporal segregation patterns across the activity space of individuals. For instance, segregation across the activity space is usually thought to be lower compared with residential segregation given the importance of social complementarity, among other factors, shaping the economies of cities. However, these new dynamic approaches to segregation convey important methodological challenges. This paper proposes a methodological framework to investigate segregation during working hours. Our approach combines three well-known mathematical tools: community detection algorithms, segregation metrics and random walk analysis. Using Santiago (Chile) as our model system, we build a detailed home\textendash work commuting network from a large dataset of mobile phone pings and spatially partition the city into several communities. We then evaluate the probability that two persons at their work location will come from the same community. Finally, a randomization analysis of commuting distances and angles corroborates the strong segregation description for Santiago provided by the sociological literature. While our findings highlights the benefit of developing new approaches to understand dynamic processes in the urban environment, unveiling counterintuitive patterns such as segregation at our workplace also shows a specific example in which the exposure dimension of segregation is successfully studied using the growingly available streams of highly detailed anonymized mobile phone registries.},

The question of asymmetry in the response to rising and falling income is also addressed. Such asymmetry may be caused by habit or resistance to change or the tendency to acquire habits to consume more easily than to abandon them. The impact of prices, the speed of adjustment and the resistance to change will be important in determining the possibility of influencing travel behaviour and specifically car use. The study utilises repeated cross-section data from the annual UK Family Expenditure Surveys and employs a pseudo-panel methodology.

The concept of level of service (LOS) has emerged as an effective tool to measure quality of services. Service-quality assessment provides operators with knowledge on users' satisfaction with existing services and their expected LOSs. The importance of user perception towards assessment of LOS has been acknowledged by researchers. While LOS standards for public transportation have been established by the Transportation Research Board in the USA, researchers have questioned the applicability of these standards in the context of different geographic regions. Since the service delivery environment differs between developed and developing nations, the user perception of service quality varies between these economic regions. Substantial research has been carried out in the context of both developed and developing nations, to identify the bus transit service parameters that affect users' perceived service quality; however, little research exists that establishes LOS thresholds for bus transit, based on user perception. This paper reviews the concept of LOS, describes the importance of user perception in assessment of service quality and identifies the need to establish LOS thresholds for bus transit from user perception for developing countries.},

Most theories applied to public health interventions tend to emphasise individual capabilities and motivation, with limited reference to context and social factors. Intervention effectiveness may be increased by drawing on a wider range of theories incorporating social, cultural and economic factors that influence behaviour. The primary aim of this paper is to identify theories of behaviour and behaviour change of potential relevance to public health interventions across four scientific disciplines: psychology, sociology, anthropology and economics. We report in detail the methodology of our scoping review used to identify these theories including which involved a systematic search of electronic databases, consultation with a multidisciplinary advisory group, web searching, searching of reference lists and hand searching of key behavioural science journals. Of secondary interest we developed a list of agreed criteria for judging the quality of the theories. We identified 82 theories and 9 criteria for assessing theory quality. The potential relevance of this wide-ranging number of theories to public health interventions and the ease and usefulness of evaluating the theories in terms of the quality criteria are however yet to be determined.},

Antarctica has the potential to contribute more than a metre of sea-level rise by 2100 and more than 15 metres by 2500, if emissions continue unabated. In this case atmospheric warming will soon become the dominant driver of ice loss, but prolonged ocean warming will delay its recovery for thousands of years.},

By highlighting areas where changes could have been made to improve the delivery of the project, it is hoped that lessons can be learnt for future projects of this type. The design approaches of each of London's 33 local authorities were cross-referenced against cycling growth and pedal cycle collisions. From the analysis, the project is shown to have had a positive impact on promoting cycling growth in central London but little identifiable impact on collisions. The article also shows how a reliance on shared-use footways as a design practice could reduce the propensity for people to cycle. As a conclusion, it is suggested that ride quality should be the primary measure of success even if, in reality, the cost of delivering this and the impact it may have on other road users may render the highest levels of service difficult to achieve at present. The paper is relevant to all those seeking to manage or set up major transport projects with time-constrained objectives. It will be of particular interest to those involved in the planning or delivery of cycling infrastructure.},

A sample of 343 Flemish adults (43\% men) living at maximum 10 km from their workplace was surveyed. Self-report measures of cycling, demographic variables, psychosocial variables, self-efficacy, perceived benefits and barriers and environmental attributes (destination, traffic variables and facilities at the workplace) of cycling for transport were obtained by means of a mailing questionnaire. Modeling and social support by accompanying, external self-efficacy, ecological-economic awareness and lack of time and interest were positively associated with the likelihood of cycling for transport and varied in importance between cyclists and non-cyclists. Cyclists estimate the time to destination shorter than non-cyclists and indicate to have more facilities for cyclists at the workplace. The results suggest that when people live in a setting with adequate bicycle infrastructure, individual determinants (psychosocial, self-efficacy, perceived benefits and barriers) outperform the role of environmental determinants in this sample. Promotion campaigns aimed at increasing cycling for transportation should focus on creating social support by encouraging cycling with partners, increasing self-efficacy, raising ecological and economic awareness, decreasing lack of time and interest barriers and providing facilities for cyclists at the workplace.},

The model recognizes a single health benefit\textendash reduced head injuries\textendash and a single health cost-increased morbidity due to foregone exercise from reduced cycling. Using estimates suggested in the literature on the effectiveness of helmets, the health benefits of cycling, head injury rates, and reductions in cycling leads to the following conclusions. In jurisdictions where cycling is safe, a helmet law is likely to have a large unintended negative health impact. In jurisdictions where cycling is relatively unsafe, helmets will do little to make it safer and a helmet law, under relatively extreme assumptions, may make a small positive contribution to net societal health. The model serves to focus the mandatory bicycle helmet law debate on overall health.},

The increasing availability of microcomputers should be able to extend the use of models to a much larger community of planners. However, even the most efficient packages existing today cannot be fitted into the standard desk-top machines. The purpose of this paper is to describe a package for land-use and transport simulation for microcomputers, showing that this is not only possible, but also that there is no need to sacrifice detail or accuracy. Furthermore, the need to produce highly compact and efficient models has forced the research team to look for completely new algorithms and even new theoretical developments. In designing the models, economy of resources was also extended to data requirements, calibration, and evaluation, and considerable attention was devoted to making the models easy to handle and the results easy to interpret. The authors begin by describing the theoretical base of the models, briefly covering random utility, decision chains, and hierarchies. Next, a summary of the mathematical formulation is presented, finishing with a description of the operative characteristics of the computer programs and complementary features.},

  abstract = {Equity has been a major concern of public transport provision and is required by legislation in many countries. Several approaches measure equity in transit supply however none produce a simple system-wide measure of equity performance. A new approach is presented using Lorenz curves to measure the relative supply of transit to the population. Gini coefficients provide a single measure of overall equity using this method. A system-wide assessment of overall transit supply to the population in Melbourne, Australia shows that 70\% of the population shares only 19\% of the supply (Gini coefficient = .68). When employment is also taken into account, the situation is not much different; 70\% of jobs and population share 23\% of service (G = .62). In order to gain some understanding of vertical equity, the transit supply was compared between different age, income and vehicle ownership groups. There is some evidence of higher supply for youth and low-income groups in inner Melbourne, and in all parts of Melbourne novehicle households lived in areas of higher transit supply. Overall it is unclear how ``fair'' these distributions are compared to equity in other cities since this is the first time this method has been undertaken. Projects using similar approaches should provide a good basis for establishing comparative equity between cities.},

Various actors are involved in landscape planning; therefore the analysis needs to take into account goals and targets of the different stakeholders. The participatory process can strongly support the development of a bottom-up forest plan definition when stakeholders are involved throughout the decision-making process. In this way, management guidelines are defined by decision makers and local communities through a shared process. With this approach, Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) is a useful tool to support the decision-making process in forest planning. The aim of the paper is to present a method that matches these requirements by exploiting the potential of GIS. The application of Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) is a useful support to integrate stakeholders' priorities and expectations into forest planning strategies. Furthermore, it represents the starting point to draw up management scenarios by integrating and comparing both technical and social priorities.

  abstract = {Our study presents a new analysis for a possible transition to a fully sustainable global energy system. It looks in detail at the various energy-using activities within each demand sector, charting their volume and physical energy intensities over time. The approach pays particular attention to maximising energy efficiency through the use of best available technologies. This leads to a reduction in total energy demand and a high share of electricity. The decrease in overall demand is achieved despite a growth in both, population and volume of energy services. The electrification occurs primarily in the Buildings and Transport sectors.We conclude that we can build a global energy system by 2050 which sources 95\% of its energy from sustainable sources following an ambitious, but feasible pathway. The pathway is considered achievable because it is based on currently available technology and realistic deployment rates. Policy measures are necessary in all sectors to provide incentives for the transition and we briefly discuss the requirements for these policies. The energy system we propose is robust with respect to (small) variations in the pathway as it only uses a small fraction of each of the sustainable sources. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The analysis focused on California, which uses gas for a large fraction of its generation and Colorado, which derives most of its electricity from coal. PV displaces gas and electricity imports almost exclusively in California, with a displacement rate of about 6000-9000 kJ per kWh of PV energy generated. In Colorado, PV offsets mostly gas at low penetration, with increasing coal displacement during nonsummer months and at higher penetration. Associated reductions in CO2, NOx, and SO2 emissions are also calculated.},

  abstract = {The importance of measuring customer satisfaction for a public transport service is apparent, even beyond more immediate marketing purposes. The present paper shows how satisfaction measures can be exploited to gain insights on the relationship between personal attitudes, transit use and urban context. We consider nine satisfaction measures of urban transit services, as expressed by a representative sample of Italian multimodal travelers (i.e. users of both private cars and public transport). We use correlations and correspondence analyses to show if and how each attribute is related to the levels of use of public transport, and how the relationship is affected by the urban context. Then we apply a recently developed method to combine ordinal variables into one score, by adapting it to work with large samples and with satisfaction measures which have a neutral point in the scale (i.e. " neither satisfied nor dissatisfied" ). The resulting overall satisfaction levels and frequency of use were not correlated in our sample. We also found the highest satisfaction levels in smaller towns and the lowest ones in metropolitan cities. Since we focus on multimodal travelers, an interpretation paradigm is proposed according to which transit services must be well evaluated by car drivers in smaller towns in order to be considered a real alternative to cars. On the other hand, transit is more competitive on factual elements in larger cities, so that it can still be used by drivers, even if it is not very well evaluated. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The findings from interviews with 28 e-bike owners in the Portland, Oregon, region provide insight into the potential market for and use of e-bikes in the United States. The interviews revealed several possible demographic markets for e-bikes that could expand the bicycling population: women, older adults, and people with physical limitations. Owners of e-bikes noted their ability to travel longer distances and over hills with relative ease and to arrive at a destination, such as work, less sweaty and less tired than a regular bicycle would allow. These features may overcome some of the common barriers to bicycling for all demographics. Most of the interviewed e-bike owners used their e-bikes to substitute for travel by either human-powered bicycles or traditional motor vehicles. Therefore, the e-bike can address concerns about health problems related to inactivity, pollution, and other public policy problems to which private vehicles contribute. Further research is needed to determine whether specific policies are needed to increase adoption of e-bikes. The potential for conflict between riders of e-bikes and of regular bikes because of speed differentials is a concern. Whether speed differentials will pose a significant problem will depend not only on the extent of adoption of e-bikes but the characteristics of the riders.},

Public authorities and researchers are relying more and more on high-speed trains (HSTs), whose efficiency is supposed to lead to a modal shift from airplanes. However, most transport studies focus on the evolution of demand rather than supply, although it is basically the latter that determines environmental damage. In light of this fact, this paper aims to compare the overall dynamics in the supply of air transport in Europe compared to the HST supply and to examine empirically five city-pairs. The development of high-speed rail remains limited compared to the increase of air services. For a given city-pair, the decline in the number of flights depends on various conditions, including length of the HST journey and the strategies adopted by the airlines. Some carriers reduce their supply in terms of the number of seats but increase the number of flights in order to compete more effectively with the HSTs. Moreover, the competition between low-cost airlines and HSTs should be kept in mind and re-examined in a few years.},

Design: Prospective observational cohort study with rapid data gathering and near real-time analysis, using a pre-approved questionnaire adopted by the WHO. Setting: 166 UK hospitals between 6th February and 18th April 2020. Participants: 16,749 people with COVID-19. Interventions: No interventions were performed, but with consent samples were taken for research purposes. Many participants were co-enrolled in other interventional studies and clinical trials. Results: The median age was 72 years [IQR 57, 82; range 0, 104], the median duration of symptoms before admission was 4 days [IQR 1,8] and the median duration of hospital stay was 7 days [IQR 4,12]. The commonest comorbidities were chronic cardiac disease (29\%), uncomplicated diabetes (19\%), non-asthmatic chronic pulmonary disease (19\%) and asthma (14\%); 47\% had no documented reported comorbidity. Increased age and comorbidities including obesity were associated with a higher probability of mortality. Distinct clusters of symptoms were found: 1. respiratory (cough, sputum, sore throat, runny nose, ear pain, wheeze, and chest pain); 2. systemic (myalgia, joint pain and fatigue); 3. enteric (abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea). Overall, 49\% of patients were discharged alive, 33\% have died and 17\% continued to receive care at date of reporting. 17\% required admission to High Dependency or Intensive Care Units; of these, 31\% were discharged alive, 45\% died and 24\% continued to receive care at the reporting date. Of those receiving mechanical ventilation, 20\% were discharged alive, 53\% died and 27\% remained in hospital. Conclusions: We present the largest detailed description of COVID-19 in Europe, demonstrating the importance of pandemic preparedness and the need to maintain readiness to launch research studies in response to outbreaks.

  abstract = {Transportation efficiency is critical for the operation of cities and is attracting great attention worldwide. Improving the transportation efficiency can not only decrease energy consumption, reduce carbon emissions, but also accelerate people's interactions, which will become more and more important for sustainable urban living. Generally, traffic conditions in less-developed countries are not so good due to the undeveloped economy and road networks, while this issue is rarely studied before, because traditional survey data in these areas are scarce. Nowadays, with the development of ubiquitous mobile phone data, we can explore the transportation efficiency in a new way. In this paper, based on users' call detailed records (CDRs), we propose an indicator named population-weighted efficiency (PWE) to quantitatively measure the efficiency of the transportation networks. PWE can provide insights into transportation infrastructure development, according to which we identify dozens of inefficient routes at both the intra- and inter-city levels, which are verified by several ongoing construction projects in Senegal. In addition, we compare PWE with excess commuting indices, and the fitting result of PWE is better than excess commuting index, which also proves the validity of our method.},

  abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of free and open source (FOSS) geographic information system (GIS) software within the broader contexts of the open source software movement and developments in GIS, and pose the question of whether libraries and academic departments should consider adopting FOSS GIS. Design/methodology/approach - The process of creating a basic thematic map was used to test six FOSS GIS software packages, as it is a multi-step process and a good example of a common task GIS users would want to perform. The test demonstrates what the process of creating a thematic map using FOSS GIS involves and how it compares to proprietary software like ArcGIS. Findings - Each of the individual FOSS GIS packages had their own particular strengths and weaknesses and some performed well for thematic mapping. The FOSS packages generally were weaker compared to ArcGIS in terms of support for various projection and coordinate systems, joining attribute data to GIS files, and automatic labeling, but their advantage is that they were free in terms of cost and licensing restrictions. When coupled with plug-ins and helper applications the viability of the FOSS GIS packages increased. Originality/value - There is little published research to date on the capabilities and applications of FOSS GIS despite the fact that it is a growing movement. This research provides a practical, application-based overview and critique of FOSS GIS. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {There has been a recent surge of research interest in quantifying the health and environmental impacts of increased cycling in urban environments. Although there is general agreement that the benefits of increased cycling outweigh the risks, most of the methodologies developed have had limited value for evaluating real-world transport policies. This is because they are based on hypothetical scenarios where increased cycling takes place but give no consideration to the courses of action which may help policymakers to achieve the scenarios. A useful extension to these methodologies would be one which allowed a user to find the optimal infrastructure design and/or policies which would maximize total societal benefit, taking into account the health and environmental impacts of cycling. In this study, a Network Design Problem is formulated for systematically designing cycling network layouts in order to maximize the net benefits to the network users and society. The problem is formulated as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) and a solution approach based on a genetic algorithm (GA) is provided to solve the problem. The problem formulation and solution algorithm are tested using a numerical example. The GA algorithm was shown to efficiently converge to an optimal or near-optimal solution for the cycle network design. The proposed optimization framework may be adopted by transport authorities and/or urban planners as a decision support tool to help them to systematically identify the best design for a cycle network which balances the benefits and risks to all stakeholders.},

We use the Key Statistics for local authorities from the 2001 Census, released on 13 February 2003 by the census authorities. All of the variables from the 26 Key Statistics tables which can be compared over time with the 1991 Census are examined. The analysis is then extended for a subset of variables that were similarly measured in 1971 and 1981. We conclude that for key aspects of life in Britain, as recorded by the censuses, the nation has continued in the 1990s to divide socially geographically, often at a faster rate than was occurring in the 1980s or 1970s. Where there appears to have been a reduction in polarisation it tends to have been for those aspects of life which are now poorly measured by the census. The paper concludes with speculation about the possible reasons for the continued division of the country into areas now more easily than ever typified as being old and young, settled and migrant, black and white, or rich and poor. Finally the potential for the continued sociospatial polarisation of Britain is discussed. The paper begins with a fictional vignette.},

Ecological public health recognizes the links between human health and global sustainability. We argue that these links are typified by the harms caused by dependence on private cars. Methods We present routine data and literature on the health impacts of private car use; the activities of the `car lobby' and factors underpinning car dependence. We compare these with experience of tobacco. Results Private cars cause significant health harm. The impacts include physical inactivity, obesity, death and injury from crashes, cardio-respiratory disease from air pollution, noise, community severance and climate change. The car lobby resists measures that would restrict car use, using tactics similar to the tobacco industry. Decisions about location and design of neighbourhoods have created environments that reinforce and reflect car dependence. Car ownership and use has greatly increased in recent decades and there is little public support for measures that would reduce this. Conclusions Car dependence is a potent example of an issue that ecological public health should address. The public health community should advocate strongly for effective policies that reduce car use and increase active travel.},

  abstract = {Abstract Proportional data, in which response variables are expressed as percentages or fractions of a whole, are analysed in many subfields of ecology and evolution. The scale-independence of proportions makes them appropriate to analyse many biological phenomena, but statistical analyses are not straightforward, since proportions can only take values from zero to one and their variance is usually not constant across the range of the predictor. Transformations to overcome these problems are often applied, but can lead to biased estimates and difficulties in interpretation. In this paper, we provide an overview of the different types of proportional data and discuss the different analysis strategies available. In particular, we review and discuss the use of promising, but little used, techniques for analysing continuous (also called non-count-based or non-binomial) proportions (e.g. percent cover, fraction time spent on an activity): beta and Dirichlet regression, and some of their most important extensions. A major distinction can be made between proportions arising from counts and those arising from continuous measurements. For proportions consisting of two categories, count-based data are best analysed using well-developed techniques such as logistic regression, while continuous proportions can be analysed with beta regression models. In the case of {$>$}2 categories, multinomial logistic regression or Dirichlet regression can be applied. Both beta and Dirichlet regression techniques model proportions at their original scale, which makes statistical inference more straightforward and produce less biased estimates relative to transformation-based solutions. Extensions to beta regression, such as models for variable dispersion, zero-one augmented data and mixed effects designs have been developed and are reviewed and applied to case studies. Finally, we briefly discuss some issues regarding model fitting, inference, and reporting that are particularly relevant to beta and Dirichlet regression. Beta regression and Dirichlet regression overcome some problems inherent in applying classic statistical approaches to proportional data. To facilitate the adoption of these techniques by practitioners in ecology and evolution, we present detailed, annotated demonstration scripts covering all variations of beta and Dirichlet regression discussed in the article, implemented in the freely available language for statistical computing, r.},

It identifies a positive association between access to these routes and the total minutes of any form of cycling, and the number of days that cycling takes place primarily for recreational purposes. The broader physical activity of individuals also has a positive association with cycling. Walking appears most likely to be complementary to non-recreational cycling, whilst participation in sport with all forms of cycling, but not with longer duration utilitarian trips. The research also indicates that access to NCN routes has the potential to increase such cycling further, with the exception of longer utilitarian trips, as does a more physically active lifestyle, particularly walking. The main policy implications of the research are to recognise that cycling is intrinsically linked to other physical activity, notably, walking, but that the NCN routes measured in this study primarily support longer duration recreational activity, which is also affected by sporting activity. This suggests that one avenue for achieving the health benefits of cycling may be through promoting NCN routes to harness a more generally active lifestyle and particularly in leisure, whilst sustainability may be further promoted through being linked more to other active travel such as walking. There is a therefore a need to exploit the potential of such NCN route provision as part of this promotion.},

Structural models of the influence of ratings of bus and carpool features and of the overall liking of buses and carpools on behavior were constructed. It was found that the relationship between rated convenience and comfort and behavior is mediated by their relationship to overall liking or modal affect. Modal affect was also consistently found to be a strong predictor of behavior. Moreover, at least for buses, modal affect influences behavior over and above the influence of rated convenience and comfort on behavior. The implications of these results for transportation planners and researchers is discussed.},

  abstract = {The increase in average distance from home to secondary school over recent decades has been accompanied by a significant growth in the proportion of pupils travelling to school by motorized means as opposed to walking or cycling. More recently this switch in travel mode has received considerable attention as declining levels of physical activity, growing car dependence and the childhood obesity ``crisis'' have pushed concerns about the health of future generations up the public health agenda, particularly in the U.S., but also in the UK and Europe. This has led to a proliferation of international studies researching a variety of individual, school and spatial characteristics associated with children's active travel to school which has been targeted by some governments as a potential silver bullet to reverse the trend. However, to date national pupil census data, which comprises annual data on all English pupils, including a mode of travel to school variable, has been under-utilised in the analysis of how pupils commute to school. Furthermore, methodologically, the grouped nature of the data with pupils clustered within both schools and residential neighbourhoods has often been ignored - an omission which can have considerable consequences for the statistical estimation of the model. The research presented here seeks to address both of these points by analysing pupil census data on all 26,709 secondary pupils (aged 11\textendash 16) who attended schools in Sheffield, UK during the 2009\textendash 10 school year. Individual pupil data is grouped within school, and neighbourhood, within a cross-classified multilevel model of active versus motorised modes of commuting to school. The results support the findings of other research that distance to school is key, but suggest that sociospatial clustering within neighbourhoods and schools is also critical. A further finding is that distance to school varies significantly by ethnicity, with white British pupils travelling the shortest distance of all ethnic groups. The implications of these findings for education and transport policy are discussed.},

Version 4 runs under MS-DOS and has as a minimum hardware requirement a 286 AT compatible with dual mono and color (EGA) graphics cards and monitors. However, to realize fully the potential of SPANS 4 a 386 machine is desirable, together with an extended memory manager. SPANS version 5 (which has additional functionality) runs under OS/2 on a 386 machine with a minimum of 8 Mbyte of memory. SPANS is a menu-driven system. In version 4 menus and help are displayed on the mono screen, with graphical output appearing on the color screen. In version 5 a hierarchy of menus is provided by windows, so that only a single (color) graphics card and monitor are needed. An interesting feature of SPANS, possibly unique amongst commercial GIS at the time SPANS was introduced, is that it uses quadtrees as the medium for storing all map data. The aim of this paper is to explore the extent to which the use of a quadtree data structure influences the functionality of the system; it should not be taken to be a complete account. SPANS terminology is indicated in bold type, and explained where necessary.},

This study rigorously and realistically tested the relative performance of spatial options over the next 30 years for three distinct kinds of English city regions. Statistical models first forecast the behavior of people within interacting markets for land and transport. These outputs were then fed to established simulation models to generate 26 indicators measuring the economic efficiency, resource use, social impact, and environmental impact of the spatial options. This permitted an explicit comparison of the costs and benefits of compact against sprawling urban forms for these regions. While the prototypes (i.e., compaction, sprawl, edge expansion, and new towns) were indeed found to differ in their sustainability, no one form was clearly superior. Rather, the change to ``white collar'' lifestyles and associated population growth dominates the impacts on the natural environment and resources, far overwhelming those attributable to spatial urban form. Takeaway for practice: Urban form policies can have important impacts on local environmental quality, economy, crowding, and social equity, but their influence on energy consumption and land use is very modest; compact development should not automatically be associated with the preferred spatial growth strategy. Research support: The research was funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Science Research Council.},

  abstract = {Obesogenic environments are a major explanation for the rapidly increasing prevalence in obesity. Investigating the relationship between obesity and obesogenic variables at the micro-level will increase our understanding about local differences in risk factors for obesity. SimObesity is a spatial microsimulation model designed to create micro-level estimates of obesogenic environment variables in the city of Leeds in the UK: consisting of a plethora of health, environment, and socio-economic variables. It combines individual micro-data from two national surveys with a coarse geography, with geographically finer scaled data from the 2001 UK Census, using a reweighting deterministic algorithm. This creates a synthetic population of individuals/households in Leeds with attributes from both the survey and census datasets. Logistic regression analyses identify suitable constraint variables to use. The model is validated using linear regression and equal variance t-tests. Height, weight, age, gender, and residential postcode data were collected on children aged 3-13 years in the Leeds metropolitan area, and obesity described as above the 98th centile for the British reference dataset. Geographically weighted regression is used to investigate the relationship between different obesogenic environments and childhood obesity. Validation shows that the small-area estimates were robust. The different obesogenic environments, as well as the parameter estimates from the corresponding local regression analyses, are mapped, all of which demonstrate non-stationary relationships. These results show that social capital and poverty are strongly associated with childhood obesity. This paper demonstrates a methodology to estimate health variables at the small-area level. The key to this technique is the choice of the model's input variables, which must be predictors for the output variables; this factor has not been stressed in other spatial microsimulation work. It also provides further evidence for the existence of obesogenic environments for children.},

The weather information recorded on Police Accident Report Forms was taken as the prevailing weather at the time of the accident. At the local authority level, accident severity for the various adverse weather categories of rain, fog, and high winds is compared with the nonhazardous condition of fine weather. Severity ratios are then calculated. Findings establish that accident severity decreases significantly in rain compared with fine weather, while severity in fog shows geographical variation. Evidence for accident severity in high winds remains inconclusive.},

In this paper, the use of social networks for conducting transport surveys is presented. The integration with e-mail providers broadens their use and makes them more suitable for data collection. In addition, statistics regarding discussions (tweets) with words related to the survey's subject were extracted from Twitter and evaluated. Since the applications of social and other internet networks are always developed, their use for internet surveys should be further examined in the future.},

  abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that cyclists choose their route differently to drivers of private vehicles. The route choice decision of commuter drivers is often modelled with one objective, to reduce their generalised travel cost, which is a monetary value representing the combined travel time and vehicle operating cost. Commuter cyclists, on the other hand, usually have multiple incommensurable objectives when choosing their route: the travel time and the suitability of a route. By suitability we mean non-subjective factors that characterise the suitability of a route for cycling, including safety, traffic volumes, traffic speeds, presence of bicycle lanes, whether the terrain is flat or hilly, etc. While these incommensurable objectives are difficult to be combined into a single objective, it is also important to take into account that each individual cyclist may prioritise differently between travel time and suitability when they choose a route. This paper proposes a novel model to determine the route choice set of commuter cyclists by formulating a bi-objective routing problem. The two objectives considered are travel time and suitability of a route for cycling. Rather than determining a single route for a cyclist, we determine a choice set of optimal alternative routes (efficient routes) from which a cyclist may select one according to their personal preference depending on their perception of travel time versus other route choice criteria considered in the suitability index. This method is then implemented in a case study in Auckland, New Zealand. The study provides a starting point for the trip assignment of cyclists, and with further research, the bi-objective routing model developed can be applied to create a complete travel demand forecast model for cycle trips. We also suggest the application of the developed methodology as an algorithm in an interactive route finder to suggest efficient route choices at different levels of suitability to cyclists and potential cyclists.},

  abstract = {To address the speeding problem in residential areas, the City of Edmonton initiated a pilot project to reduce the posted speed limit from 50km/h to 40km/h within six residential communities. This paper investigates the community perceptions of traffic safety within the six pilot communities in two phases: prior to project initiation (pre-pilot) and following the end of the project (post-pilot). This objective was accomplished by analyzing the results of two random dialing telephone surveys comprising 300 residents each. A preliminary analysis showed compatible demographic configurations for the two samples and confirmed that the residents were aware of both the posted speed limits and the adopted speed management controls. For the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), a two-group (pre-pilot and post-pilot) three-factor model was used to assess the residents' perceptions of the speeding behavior (Speeding), their concerns about traffic safety issues (Concerns), and their perceptions of traffic safety (Safety). Comparing the CFA results of the post-pilot survey versus those of the pre-pilot survey, it was evident that there was a significant decrease in Speeding and Concerns accompanied by a significant increase in Safety. A structural equations model (SEM) was also fitted to the data in order to assess the impact of Speeding and Concerns on Safety. The results showed that Concerns increase significantly with Speeding, and that both factors have significant negative impacts on Safety. However, while the impact of Concerns on Safety was direct, that of Speeding on Safety was largely indirect (i.e., mediated through Concerns). Overall, the multivariate analysis has demonstrated that the pilot project was successful in improving the residents' perceptions of traffic safety in their community.},

  abstract = {The percentage of the population being served by a transit system in a metropolitan region is a key system performance measure but depends heavily on the definition of service area. Observing existing service areas can help identify transit system gaps and redundancies. In the public transit industry, buffers at 400 m (0.25 miles) around bus stops and 800 m (0.5 miles) around rail stations are commonly used to identify the area from which most transit users will access the system by foot. This study uses detailed OD survey information to generate service areas that define walking catchment areas around transit services in Montreal, Canada. The 85th percentile walking distance to bus transit service is found to be around 524 m for home-based trip origins, 1,259 m for home-based commuter rail trip origins. Yet these values are found to vary based on our analysis using two statistical models. Walking distances vary based on route and trip qualities (such as type of transit service, transfers and wait time), as well as personal, household, and neighbourhood characteristics. Accordingly, service areas around transit stations should vary based on the service offered and attributes of the people and places served. The generated service areas derived from the generalized statistical model are then used to identify gaps and redundancies at the system and route level using Montreal region as an example. This study can be of benefit to transport engineers and planners trying to maximize transit service coverage in a region while avoiding oversupply of service. \textcopyright{} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

However, although a polygon can be triangulated in linear time, such a procedure is conceptually difficult and not practically efficient.

Subsequent responses to these critiques have fundamentally altered the technological, political, and intellectual practices of GIScience. Participatory GIS, for instance, has intervened in multiple ways to try to ameliorate uneven access to GIS and digital spatial data and diversify the forms of spatial knowledge and spatial logic that may be incorporated in a GIS. While directly addressing core elements of the `GIS \& Society' critique, these reconstructions of a critical GIScience introduce their own ambiguities with respect to access, equity, digital representation of spatial knowledge, and epistemologies of new GIS research practices. In this paper, I examine some of the new and persistent ambiguities of participatory GIS that bear inclusion in future critical GIScience research.},

Using data scraped from the application programming interfaces of two TNCs, combined with observed travel time data, we find that contrary to their vision, TNCs are the biggest contributor to growing traffic congestion in San Francisco. Between 2010 and 2016, weekday vehicle hours of delay increased by 62\% compared to 22\% in a counterfactual 2016 scenario without TNCs. The findings provide insight into expected changes in major cities as TNCs continue to grow, informing decisions about how to integrate TNCs into the existing transportation system. Transportation network companies (TNCs), such as Uber and Lyft, are the major driver of increasing traffic congestion in San Francisco.

  abstract = {Automated road network extraction from remote sensing imagery remains a significant challenge despite its importance in a broad array of applications. To this end, we explore road network extraction at scale with inference of semantic features of the graph, identifying speed limits and route travel times for each roadway. We call this approach City-Scale Road Extraction from Satellite Imagery v2 (CRESIv2), Including estimates for travel time permits true optimal routing (rather than just the shortest geographic distance), which is not possible with existing remote sensing imagery based methods. We evaluate our method using two sources of labels (OpenStreetMap, and those from the SpaceNet dataset), and find that models both trained and tested on SpaceNet labels outperform OpenStreetMap labels by {$\geq$} 60\%. We quantify the performance of our algorithm with the Average Path Length Similarity (APLS) and map topology (TOPO) graph-theoretic metrics over a diverse test area covering four cities in the SpaceNet dataset. For a traditional edge weight of geometric distance, we find an aggregate of 5\% improvement over existing methods for SpaceNet data. We also test our algorithm on Google satellite imagery with OpenStreetMap labels, and find a 23\% improvement over previous work. Metric scores decrease by only 4\% on large graphs when using travel time rather than geometric distance for edge weights, indicating that optimizing routing for travel time is feasible with this approach.},

Our approach includes, in addition to geospatial processing, data acquisition services that are essential especially when dealing with satellite images and applications in the area of remote sensing and similar fields. As a result, by putting in a common framework all data and geoprocesses available in the Cloud, it is possible to combine the appropriate services in order to produce a solution for a specific need. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Authors.},

With data from Gainesville, Florida, a multinomial logit model was estimated to explain school mode choice for a sample of K-12 students. Students with shorter walk or bike times to school proved significantly more likely to walk or bike. If confirmed through subsequent research, this finding argues for neighborhood schools serving nearby residential areas. Students traveling through areas with sidewalks on main roads were also more likely to walk. If confirmed, this finding argues for "safe routes to school" sidewalk improvements. As noteworthy as the significant factors are those that did not prove significant. School enrollment was not significant after controlling for travel time between home and school. Larger schools may draw students from larger areas and thereby indirectly affect mode choices. But school size does not appear to have a direct effect on mode choices. Land use variables such as density and mix also were not significant. The travel behavior literature emphasizes the importance of such variables in travel decision making. Apparently, school trips are different. They tend to be unlinked to other activities, and thus reduce the need for proximity to other land uses. They are mandatory; thus the walking environment may be less important than it is with discretionary travel. And school trips involve children, who may be less sensitive to walking conditions than are their adult counterparts.},

  abstract = {External cost (XC) accounting of air pollution has been applied in a number of energy system studies in order to find least-cost solutions from a social-cost perspective. In these studies, the economic evaluation covers the XCs apart from the private costs. The greater number of life cycle processes, pollutants and environmental impacts covered, the more accurate the results will be but, obviously, the XC accounting process will be more complex and time-consuming. There is also the risk of increasing uncertainty as complexity increases, and the question is to decide on the appropriate level of comprehensiveness. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate certain simplified XC accounting approaches applied to a study of the district-heating (DH) system of Gothenburg, Sweden. The methodology applied is to vary the inclusion of pollutants and life cycle processes in the XC accounting under different scenarios. The results show that if environmental costs are estimated to be substantial and the net power generated in the DH system is assumed to replace generation in coal-fuelled power plants, limiting the coverage of life cycle processes and pollutants outside the DH system would not be appropriate. Instead, if assuming that power generation based on natural gas were replaced, the application of all simplified approaches studied leads to DH solutions that are congruent with those obtained employing a more comprehensive approach and is, thus, considered to be sufficient. However, results also show that certain simplified approaches are justified regardless of the assumed power generation replacement and given a wide range of environmental cost estimates used in the study, such as limiting the number of covered pollutants to the most relevant ones (CO 2, SO 2 and NO x). Thus, a less comprehensive XC accounting process may be considered appropriate for finding least social-cost solutions in the Gothenburg DH system, as well as potentially in many other DH systems featuring similar technical and environmental performance. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

LTDS is a rolling household survey carried out throughout the year with residents of London. Travel information is collected for household members aged five and over for a given travel day based on an annual sample of around 8000 households. Active travel by Inner and Outer London residents was analysed using a multivariate logistic regression of indicators related to active travel, including car ownership, bicycle use, age, gender, ethnicity, household income and employment. Social correlates of active travel were similar among Inner and Outer London residents. Significant differences in the likelihood of achieving 30 min of active travel were found by household car ownership, age, income, bicycle ownership and employment. People living in non-car owning households were between two and three times (OR 2.5 and 3.3) more likely to travel actively for 30 min on a given day than people in multi-car owning households. People who own and use a bicycle were around twice as likely (OR 1.8 and 2.2) to travel actively for at least 30 min compared to those who do not own a bicycle.},

In default of offering convenient and reliable service the passengers tend to consider other transport alternatives.

Using the power of crowd to gather the required data, share information and send feedback is a viable and cost effective alternative. In this demonstration, we present TrafficInfo, our prototype smart phone application to implement a participatory sensing based live public transport information service. TrafficInfo visualizes the actual position of public transport vehicles with live updates on a map, and gives support to crowd sourced data collection and passenger feedback.},

Yet there exists no set of best practices and surprisingly little research detailing which sorts of cycling infrastructure may be better or worse in terms of exposure to harmful pollutants. A large air-quality data collection campaign was conducted in summer 2012 whereby cyclists equipped with ultrafine particle (UFP) and black carbon (BC) monitors covered over 550 kilometers of streets, including 325 kilometers of designated cycling facilities on the Island of Montreal. The clearest result from this exercise is that pollution levels on trails, often far from vehicular streets, are markedly lower than cycling facilities located on or alongside the street. For in-street and separated facilities, both UFP and BC were more closely associated with the hierarchy of the street than the type of cycling facility. Between in-street and separated facilities, the difference in UFP levels was not statistically significant. However, the difference between BC levels on in-street and separated facilities was significant, with separated facilities yielding lower concentrations. Ultimately, more research is needed to understand the potential efficacy of facility and network design as a pollution exposure abatement measure; however, these findings show moderate advantages of separated facilities over in-street facilities and more substantial advantages for off-road facilities over either.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model for predicting accident counts in future years at sites within a pool of potential road safety hotspots. The aim is to inform road safety practitioners of the location of likely future hotspots to enable a proactive, rather than reactive, approach to road safety scheme implementation. A feature of our model is the ability to rank sites according to their potential to exceed, in some future time period, a threshold accident count which may be used as a criterion for scheme implementation. Our model specification enables the classical empirical Bayes formulation \textendash{} commonly used in before-and-after studies, wherein accident counts from a single before period are used to estimate counterfactual counts in the after period \textendash{} to be extended to incorporate counts from multiple time periods. This allows site-specific variations in historical accident counts (e.g. locally-observed trends) to offset estimates of safety generated by a global accident prediction model (APM), which itself is used to help account for the effects of global trend and regression-to-mean (RTM). The Bayesian posterior predictive distribution is exploited to formulate predictions and to properly quantify our uncertainty in these predictions. The main contributions of our model include (i) the ability to allow accident counts from multiple time-points to inform predictions, with counts in more recent years lending more weight to predictions than counts from time-points further in the past; (ii) where appropriate, the ability to offset global estimates of trend by variations in accident counts observed locally, at a site-specific level; and (iii) the ability to account for unknown/unobserved site-specific factors which may affect accident counts. We illustrate our model with an application to accident counts at 734 potential hotspots in the German city of Halle; we also propose some simple diagnostics to validate the predictive capability of our model. We conclude that our model accurately predicts future accident counts, with point estimates from the predictive distribution matching observed counts extremely well.},

  abstract = {Background: Cycling is perceived as an unsafe travel mode in many countries. However, road deaths in England have fallen sharply since 2007. We explored whether differences in fatality rates by age, gender and mode persist, and the associations of deprivation with these. Methods: Using ONS (cycling, pedestrian) and Stats19 (driving) 2007\textendash 2012 data for travel-related deaths, including pedestrian falls, and National Travel Surveys 2007\textendash 2012 travel data, we calculated fatality rates for England by distance (f/bnkm) and time travelled (million hours' use, f/mhu) by age, travel mode, and gender or residential Index of Multiple Deprivation. Results: Fatality rates fell significantly 2007\textendash 2009 to 2010\textendash 2012: male f/bnkm from 2.8 (95\%CI 2.7\textendash 2.9) to 2.0 (1.9\textendash 2.1) for driving; 32.1 (28.5\textendash 36.0) to 20.8 (18.1\textendash 23.9) for cycling; and 51.4 (48.5\textendash 54.4) to 36.7 (34.3\textendash 39.3) for walking. Fatality rates varied by age, gender, and mode. Driving and walking fatality rate ratios were generally higher for males than females. For males 17\textendash 20y, fatality rates were 0.76 (0.69\textendash 0.83)/mhu for driving and 0.28 (0.18\textendash 0.42)/mhu for cycling but were similar by distance. Age-specific rates were J-shape for cycling, U-shape for driving, and increased exponentially with age for walking. Fatality rates aged 80+ were an order of magnitude higher in each mode than the all-age mean. Compared with those aged 17\textendash 20, rate ratios were significantly lower for male drivers 21+ and female drivers 21\textendash 74, but were higher for male cyclists aged 55+ and pedestrians 45+ (male) and 65+ (female). People living in the most deprived quintile generally had higher fatality rates than those in the least deprived quintile overall (three modes combined) and for walking but not for cycling; Rate ratios were highest for pedestrians 35\textendash 64 and drivers 35\textendash 54. Conclusions: Fatality rates for walking, cycling and driving are higher for males than females at almost every age and vary more by age than by travel mode. Deprivation exacerbates walking and driving fatality rates.},

However, psycho-social factors that make the bicycle eligible as a modal alternative have not been identified properly. These factors are related to intention, attitudes and perceptions, and their identification can contribute to obtain the keys for a successful bicycle policy. Here, an in-depth investigation of cyclists' perceptions is attempted using a large university survey designed and collected ad hoc, and then applying exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. After identifying fourteen factors, a structural equations model was estimated to find structure and relationships among variables and to understand users' intentions to use the bike. Four (latent) variables are identified, namely convenience, pro-bike, physical determinants and exogenous restrictions. The main conclusion is that convenience (flexible, efficient) and exogenous restrictions (danger, vandalism, facilities) are the most important elements to understand the attitudes towards the bicycle.},

In this perspective, we propose ACHILLES, an application to model people's movements in a given transport system mode through a multiplex network representation based on mobility data. ACHILLES is a web-based application which provides an easy-to-use interface to explore the mobility fluxes and the connectivity of every urban zone in a city, as well as to visualize changes in the transport system resulting from the addition or removal of transport modes, urban zones, and single stops. Notably, our application allows the user to assess the overall resilience of the transport network by identifying its weakest node, i.e. Urban Achilles Heel, with reference to the ancient Greek mythology. To demonstrate the impact of ACHILLES for humanitarian aid we consider its application to a real-world scenario by exploring human mobility in Singapore in response to flood prevention.},

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative global map that was built by volunteers and is promising for active transportation research. In this article, we use OSM to inventory bicycling infrastructure in six Canadian cities, compare it to municipal open data, and provide guidance for practitioners using OSM data. We conducted an evaluation of OSM and open data, overall and for four categories of bicycle infrastructure: cycle tracks; on-street bicycle lanes; paths (bicycle only or multiuse); and local street bikeways. We found that the concordance in terms of total length of OSM infrastructure to open data infrastructure very high in two of the six cities ({$<$} {$\pm$}2\%), and reasonably high in all cities (maximum difference {$\pm$}30\%). Concordance for infrastructure categories was highest for on-street bicycle lanes, which were the most common, and easily identifiable type of bicycle infrastructure in the OSM data, and lowest for cycle tracks and local street bikeways, both of which are new or relatively rare infrastructure types in some Canadian cities. In some cases, OSM was more detailed and timely than open data. A challenge in OSM is consistent tagging of bicycle infrastructure types. We encourage practitioners to consider OSM data for multicity studies, but to be mindful of potential inconsistencies in attribution and local definitions. We also recommend users of OSM to publish data queries for repeatability.},

It combines rock-solid statistics coverage with compelling visual story-telling to address the conceptual difficulties that students learning statistics for the first time often encounter in introductory courses - guiding students away from rote memorization and toward critical thinking and problem solving. Field masterfully weaves in a unique, action-packed story starring Zach, a character who thinks like a student, processing information, and the challenges of understanding it, in the same way a statistics novice would. Illustrated with stunning graphic novel-style art and featuring Socratic dialogue, the story captivates readers as it introduces them to concepts, eliminating potential statistics anxiety.~ The book assumes no previous statistics knowledge nor does it require the use of data analysis software. It covers the material you would expect for an introductory level statistics course that Field's other books (Discovering Statistics Using IBM SPSS Statistics and Discovering Statistics Using R) only touch on, but with a contemporary twist, laying down strong foundations for understanding classical and Bayesian approaches to data analysis.~ In doing so, it provides an unrivalled launch pad to further study, research, and inquisitiveness about the real world, equipping students with the skills to succeed in their chosen degree and which they can go on to apply in the workplace. The Story and Main Characters The Reality Revolution In the City of Elpis, in the year 2100, there has been a reality revolution. Prior to the revolution, Elpis citizens were unable to see their flaws and limitations, believing themselves talented and special. This led to a self-absorbed society in which hard work and the collective good were undervalued and eroded. To combat this, Professor Milton Grey invented the reality prism, a hat that allowed its wearers to see themselves as they really~were - flaws and all. Faced with the truth, Elpis citizens revolted and destroyed and banned all reality prisms. The Mysterious Disappearance Zach and Alice are born soon after all the prisms have been destroyed. Zach, a musician who doesn't understand science, and Alice, a geneticist who is also a whiz at statistics, are in love. One night, after making a world-changing discovery, Alice suddenly disappears, leaving behind a song playing on a loop and a file with her research on it. Statistics to the Rescue! Sensing that she might be in danger, Zach follows the clues to find her, as he realizes that the key to discovering why Alice has vanished is in her research. Alas! He must learn statistics and apply what he learns in order to overcome a number of deadly challenges and find the love of his life. As Zach and his pocket watch, The Head, embark on their quest to find Alice, they meet Professor Milton Grey and Celia, battle zombies, cross a probability bridge, and encounter Jig:Saw, a mysterious corporation that might have something to do with Alice's disappearance\ldots{} Author News  "Eight years ago I had the idea to write a fictional story through which the student learns statistics via a shared adventure with the main character..."

Warming and drying trends are likely to induce substantial species-range shifts, and imply a need for migration rates that will exceed the capacity of many endemic species. Land use, habitat fragmentation and intense human pressures will further limit natural adaptation responses, and fire-regime shifts may threaten specific species and plant functional types. Vegetation structural change driven by dominant, common or invasive species may also threaten rare species. Overall, a loss of biodiversity and carbon sequestration services may be realised over much of these regions.},

This synthesis of previous works, both peer-reviewed and gray, includes an identification of the current gaps in knowledge related to the impacts of bike sharing programs. This synthesis represents a critically needed evalu- ation of the current state of global bike share research, in order to better understand, and maximize the effectiveness of current and future programs. Several consistent themes have emerged within the growing body of research on bike share programs. Firstly, the importance bike share members place on convenience and value for money appears paramount in their motivation to sign up and use these programs. Secondly, and somewhat counter intuitively, scheme members are more likely to own and use private bicycles than nonmembers. Thirdly, users demonstrate a greater reluctance to wear helmets than private bicycle riders and helmets have acted as a deterrent in jurisdictions in which helmets are mandatory. Finally, and perhaps most importantly from a sustainable transport perspective, the majority of scheme users are substituting from sustainable modes of transport rather than the car. Keywords:},

  abstract = {The number of cities offering bikeshare has increased rapidly, from just a handful in the late 1990s to over 800 currently. This paper provides a review of recent bikeshare literature. Several themes have begun to emerge from studies examining bikeshare. Convenience is the major motivator for bikeshare use. Financial savings has been found to motivate those on a low income and the distance one lives from a docking station is an important predictor for bikeshare membership. In a range of countries, it has been found that just under 50\% of bikeshare members use the system less than once a month. Men use bikeshare more than women, but the imbalance is not as dramatic as private bike riding (at least in low cycling countries). Commuting is the most common trip purpose for annual members. Users are less likely than private cyclists to wear helmets, but in countries with mandatory helmet legislation, usage levels have suffered. Bikeshare users appear less likely to be injured than private bike riders. Future directions include integration with ebikes, GPS (global positioning system), dockless systems and improved public transport integration. Greater research is required to quantify the impacts of bikeshare, in terms of mode choice, emissions, congestion and health.},

  abstract = {The coordination of bicycle and transit modes has received close attention from public transit planners and researchers in recent years as transit agencies around the world have installed bicycle racks on transit vehicles, implemented bicycles-on-trains policies, and made other efforts to facilitate bicycle transit integration. Many planners presume that the catchment area for transit is enlarged by these efforts, but geographic changes in the size of catchment areas have not been documented effectively. The research project reported in this paper assessed the distances traveled on bicycle by cycle transit users (CTUs) and included (a) those who used bicycles as a means of access to transit stops and stations and (b) those who bicycled to and traveled on transit with their bicycles. A mixed. methods approach was employed, with a literature review; a survey of CTUs in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and San Francisco, California; and telephone interviews with a subset of survey respondents. Responses in the two cities made it possible to define CTU characteristics and behavior in detail. The responses highlighted two intriguing findings. First, transit catchment areas could be much larger for CTUs than for traditional transit users who accessed transit buses and rail on foot. Second, the concept of a cycle transit catchment area was seen to be complex because of the variety of travel opportunities that cycle transit coordination policies presented to transit riders. CTUs took advantage of larger catchment areas to reduce their travel costs, and they used those catchment areas in curious and less predictable ways.},

This research assesses the geographic distribution of cycling infrastructure with regard to community demographic characteristics to assess claims that cycling investment arrives in tandem with incoming populations of privilege or is targeted towards neighborhoods with existing socioeconomic wealth. Using census and municipal cycling infrastructure data in Chicago and Portland from 1990 to 2010, we create demographic and cycling infrastructure investment indices at the census tract level. Linear regressions estimate the extent to which existing community demographics and change in demographics associated with gentrification are related to cycling infrastructure investment. In both cities, we identify a bias towards increased cycling infrastructure investment in areas of existing or increasing privilege. This paper suggests that marginalized communities are unlikely to attract as much cycling infrastructure investment without the presence of privileged populations, even when considering population density and distance to downtown, two motivators of urban cycling. To alleviate the continuation of inequitable distributions of cycling investments, planning processes may actively seek out diverse stakeholders and be sensitive to citywide community input and stated needs in future transportation projects.},

Previous work has shown that the application of a novel calibration technique that adjusts all choice dimensions at once from traffic counts yields cross-validation results that are competitive with any state-of-the-art four-step model. While the previous study aims at a methodological illustration of the calibration method, this work focuses on the real-world scenario, and it elaborates on the usefulness of the obtained results for further demand analysis purposes.},

Adults from one of three study areas - surrounding the new motorway (South), an existing motorway (East), or no motorway (North) - completed a previous day travel record. Adjusted two-part regression models examined associations between exposure and outcome. Compared to the North, cohort participants in the South were more likely to undertake travel by any mode (OR 2.1, 95\% CI 1.0-4.2) at follow-up. Within the South study area, cohort participants living closer to a motorway junction were more likely to travel by any mode at follow-up (OR 4.7, 95\% CI 1.1-19.7), and cross-sectional participants living closer were more likely to use a car at follow-up (OR 3.4, 95\% CI 1.1-10.7), compared to those living further away. Overall, the new motorway appeared to promote travel and car use in those living nearby, but did not influence active travel. This may propagate socioeconomic inequalities in non-car owners.},

This article seeks to analyse how CE are treated by professionals engaged in Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Strategic Environmental Assessment of roads and railways. The aims were (i) to analyse views of CE held by professionals with long planning practice, (ii) to analyse how planners experience the handling of CE in their daily planning practice, and (iii) to identify means to strengthen the assessment of CE in the Swedish road and railway planning process. The study was performed as an international literature review and two focus groups among planners. Discussions revealed little knowledge and use of the term CE, partly due to lack of incentives and guidance. Little mention was made of research. Participants said EIA work was much directed towards the environmental compartments/aspects listed in the Environmental Code. Environmental impacts designated as significant demanded much work. The discussions revealed a need of more collaboration between various actors in EIA and of novel methods of public participation. Spatial and temporal scales were chosen with little concern of CE. The European Landscape Convention was hoped to enhance CE treatment in EIA. Improvement suggestions include (i) use of the term CE in regulatory instruments, (ii) development of the interplay between CEA practice and CE science, (iii) co-ordination of management of baseline, monitoring and follow-up data, (iv) assessment of CE in relation to project-specific environmental objectives, developed in a bottom-up process, (v) inclusion of CE, within and across environmental aspects, in determining the significance of environmental impacts, (vi) advice on CE treatment in EIA guidelines, (vii) requirement of CE assessment in EIA procurement, (viii) strengthened generalist competence in environmental assessment, and (ix) enhancing skills in stepwise analyses and indirect environmental effects. Research needs include adaptation of the Swedish EIA procedure to international state of the art, knowledge support of quantification in CE assessment, and development of innovative means of public consultation in transport infrastructure planning.},

This paper presents a simple GIS-based tool developed to allow the rapid analysis of accessibility by different transport modes. Designed to be flexible and use publicly-available data, this tool (built in ArcGIS) uses generalized cost to measure transport costs across networks including monetary and distance components. The utility of the tool is demonstrated on London, UK, showing the differing patterns of accessibility across the city by different modes. It is shown that these patterns can be examined spatially, by accessibility to particular destinations (e.g., employment locations), or as a global measure across a whole city system. A number of future infrastructure scenarios are tested, examining the potential for increasing the use of low-carbon forms of transport. It is shown that private car journeys are still the least cost mode choice in London, but that infrastructure investments can play a part in reducing the cost of more sustainable transport options.},

Findings: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from the UK European Prospective Investigation of Cancer (EPIC) Norfolk cohort in 2009. We used a geographical information system (GIS) and gender specific multivariate models to relate 13 927 participants' reported levels of cycling with an index of road traffic volume (Road Traffic Volume Index Score - RTVIS). RTVIS were calculated around each participants home, using four distance based buffers, (0.5 km, 1 km, 2 km and 3.2 km). Models were adjusted for age, social status, education, car access and deprivation. Both genders had similar decreases in leisure cycling as traffic volumes increased at greater distances from home (OR 0.42, (95\% CI 0.32-0.52, p  0.001) for women and OR 0.41, (95\% CI 0.33-0.50, p  0.001) for men in the highest quartile at 3.2 km). There was no effect of traffic volumes at any distance on commuter cycling. Conclusions: Traffic volumes appear to have greater impact on leisure cycling than commuter cycling. Future research should investigate the importance of traffic on different types of cycling and include psychosocial correlates.},

  abstract = {The quantity, diversity and availability of transport data is increasing rapidly, requiring~new skills in the management and interrogation of data and databases. Recent years~have seen a new wave of "big data", "Data Science", and "smart cities" changing the~world, with the Harvard Business Review describing Data Science as the "sexiest job of~the 21st century". Transportation professionals and researchers need to be able to use~data and databases in order to establish quantitative, empirical facts, and to validate~and challenge their mathematical models, whose axioms have traditionally often been~assumed rather than rigorously tested against data. This book takes a highly practical~approach to learning about Data Science tools and their application to investigating~transport issues. The focus is principally on practical, professional work with real data~and tools, including business and ethical issues."Transport modeling practice was developed in a data poor world, and many of our current techniques and skills are building on that sparsity. In a new data rich world, the required tools are different and the ethical questions around data and privacy are definitely different. I am not sure whether current professionals have these skills; and I am certainly not convinced that our current transport modeling tools will survive in a data rich environment. This is an exciting time to be a data scientist in the transport field. We are trying to get to grips with the opportunities that big data sources offer; but at the same time such data skills need to be fused with an understanding of transport, and of transport modeling. Those with these combined skills can be instrumental at providing better, faster, cheaper data for transport decision- making; and ultimately contribute to innovative, efficient, data driven modeling techniques of the future. It is not surprising that this course, this book, has been authored by the Institute for Transport Studies. To do this well, you need a blend of academic rigor and practical pragmatism. There are few educational or research establishments better equipped to do that than ITS Leeds".~- Tom van Vuren, Divisional Director, Mott MacDonald"WSP is proud to be a thought leader in the world of transport modelling, planning and economics, and has a wide range of opportunities for people with skills in these areas. The evidence base and forecasts we deliver to effectively implement strategies and schemes are ever more data and technology focused a trend we have helped shape since the 1970's, but with particular disruption and opportunity in recent years. As a result of these trends, and to suitably skill the next generation of transport modellers, we asked the world-leading Institute for Transport Studies, to boost skills in these areas, and they have responded with a new MSc programme which you too can now study via this book."~- Leighton Cardwell, Technical Director, WSP."From processing and analysing large datasets, to automation of modelling~tasks sometimes requiring different software packages to "talk" to each other,~to data visualization, SYSTRA employs a range of techniques and tools to~provide our clients with deeper insights and effective solutions. This book~does an excellent job in giving you the skills to manage, interrogate and~analyse databases, and develop powerful presentations. Another important~publication from ITS Leeds."~ -~Fitsum Teklu, Associate Director (Modelling \& Appraisal) SYSTRA Ltd"Urban planning has relied for decades on statistical and computational practices that have little to do with mainstream data science. Information is still often used as evidence on the impact of new infrastructure even when it hardly contains any valid evidence. This book is an extremely welcome effort to provide young professionals with the skills needed to analyse how cities and transport networks actually work. The book is also highly relevant toanyone who will later want to build digital solutions to optimise urban travelbased on emerging data sources".~ - Yaron Hollander, author of "Transport Modelling for a Complete Beginner"},

There is little evidence of impact on physical activity of active transport strategies which modify the built environment. Cycling represents one virtually carbon-neutral form of transport that can help to address declining levels of exercise. METHODS: A systematic literature review of experimental or observational studies that objectively evaluated the effect of the built environment on cycling. RESULTS: A total of 21 studies met the inclusion criteria, all of which were observational studies. Eleven studies identified objectively measured environmental factors with a significant positive association with cycling. The environmental factors identified as being positively associated with cycling included presence of dedicated cycle routes or paths, separation of cycling from other traffic, high population density, short trip distance, proximity of a cycle path or green space and for children projects promoting 'safe routes to school'. Negative environmental factors were perceived and objective traffic danger, long trip distance, steep inclines and distance from cycle paths. Of the seven studies which focused primarily on the impact of cycle routes, four demonstrated a statistically significant positive association. CONCLUSION: Although the study identified environmental factors with positive and negative associations with cycling behaviour, many other types of environmental policies and interventions have yet to be rigorously evaluated. Policies promoting cycle lane construction appear promising but the socio-demographic distribution of their effects on physical activity is unclear. The wider impact of active transport policies on health and inequalities across Europe must be explored.},

This study assessed whether engagement in active travel is associated with neighborhood walkability measured for zip codes in New York City. Data were analyzed on engagement in active travel and the frequency of walking or biking ten blocks or more in the past month, from 8,064 respondents to the New York City 2003 Community Health Survey (CHS). A neighborhood walkability scale that measures: residential, intersection, and subway stop density; land use mix; and the ratio of retail building floor area to retail land area was calculated for each zip code. Data were analyzed using zero-inflated negative binomial regression incorporating survey sample weights and adjusting for respondents' sociodemographic characteristics. Overall, 44 \% of respondents reported no episodes of active travel and among those who reported any episode, the mean number was 43.2 episodes per month. Comparing the 75th to the 25th percentile of zip code walkability, the odds ratio for reporting zero episodes of active travel was 0.71 (95 \% CI 0.61, 0.83) and the exponentiated beta coefficient for the count of episodes of active travel was 1.13 (95 \% CI 1.06, 1.21). Associations between lower walkability and reporting zero episodes of active travel were significantly stronger for non-Hispanic Whites as compared to non-Hispanic Blacks and to Hispanics and for those living in higher income zip codes. The results suggest that neighborhood walkability is associated with higher engagement in active travel.},

The prevalence of BIXI bicycle use was estimated. Multivariate logistic regression allowed for identification of correlates of use. Data analysis was conducted in spring and summer 2010. Results The unweighted mean age of respondents was 47.4 (SD=16.8) years and 61.4\% were female. The weighted prevalence for use of BIXI bicycles at least once was 8.2\%. Significant correlates of BIXI bicycle use were having a BIXI docking station within 250 m of home, being aged 18\textendash 24 years, being university educated, being on work leave, and using cycling as the primary mode of transportation to work. Conclusions A newly implemented public bicycle share program attracts a substantial fraction of the population and is more likely to attract younger and more educated people who currently use cycling as a primary transportation mode.},

  abstract = {Background: Evidence of associations between active transportation (walking and bicycling for transportation) and health outcomes is limited. Better understanding of this relationship would inform efforts to increase physical activity by promoting active transportation. Purpose: This study examined associations between active transportation and cardiovascular disease risk factors in U.S. adults. Methods: Using the 2007-2008 and 2009-2010 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), adults (N=9933) were classified by level of active transportation. Multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses controlled for sociodemographic characteristics, smoking status, and minutes/week of non-active transportation physical activity. Analyses were conducted in 2011. Results: Overall, 76\% reported no active transportation. Compared with no active transportation, mean BMI was lower among individuals with low (-0.9, 95\% CI= -1.4, -0.5) and high (-1.2, 95\% CI= -1.7, -0.8) levels of active transportation. Mean waist circumference was lower in the low (-2.2 cm, 95\% CI= -3.2, -1.2) and high (-3.1 cm, 95\% CI= -4.3, -1.9) active transportation groups. The odds of hypertension were 24\% lower (AOR=0.76, 95\% CI=0.61, 0.94) and 31\% lower (AOR=0.69, 95\% CI=0.58, 0.83) among individuals with low and high levels of active transportation, respectively, compared with no active transportation. High active transportation was associated with 31\% lower odds of diabetes (AOR=0.69, 95\% CI=0.54, 0.88). Active transportation was not associated with high-density lipoprotein level. Conclusions: Active transportation was associated with more-favorable cardiovascular risk factor profiles, providing additional justification for infrastructure and policies that permit and encourage active transportation. ?? 2012 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

  abstract = {Information flow plays a central role in the development of transport policy, transport planning and the effective operation of the transport system. The recent upsurge in web enabled and pervasive technologies offer the opportunity of a new route for dynamic information flow that captures the views, needs and experiences of the travelling public in a timely and direct fashion through social media text posts. To date there is little published research, however, on how to realize this opportunity for the sector by capturing and analysing the text data. This paper provides an overview of the different categories of social media, the characteristics of its content and how these characteristics are reflected in transport-related posts. The research described in this paper includes a formulation of the goals for harvesting transport-related information from social media, the hypotheses to be tested to demonstrate that such information can provide valuable input to transport policy development or delivery and the challenges this involves. A hierarchical approach for categorizing transport-related information harvested from social media is presented. An explanatory study was designed, based on the understanding of the nature of social media content, the goals in harvesting it for transport planning and management purposes and existing text mining techniques. An exploratory case study is used to illustrate the process based on Twitter posts associated with particular UK sporting fixtures (i.e. football matches). The results demonstrate both the volume and pertinence of the information obtained. Whilst text-mining techniques have been applied in a number of other sectors (notably entertainment, business and the political arena), the use of information in the transport sector has some unique features that stem from both day-to-day operational practices and the longer term decision making processes surrounding the transport system \textendash{} hence the significance and novelty of the results reported here. Many challenges in refining the methodology and techniques remain for future research, however the outcomes presented here are of relevance to a wide range of stakeholders in the transport and text mining fields.},

This article analyzes the ways urban cyclists use and create bicycling infrastructure in the city of Quito, Ecuador. It uses an ethnographic approach to understand how infrastructure is systematically produced through various relationships with human actors and non-human phenomena. The article starts from the perspective of the ethnographer moving within the assemblage of the feminist bicycle collective Carishina en Bici. The ethnographer drew on feminist science and technology studies (STS) approaches to cultivate everyday relationships of `care' to become a moving part of an infrastructural assemblage. The study of infrastructure entails carefully choosing research relationships that result in intra-action, or the coming together of the subjects and objects of a study to produce infrastructure. The article uses the term experimental infrastructure to reveal the procedures of studying and analyzing the political dynamics that result from bicycling infrastructure. It draws on 15 months of fieldwork in Quito, Ecuador, and participatory photo travel diaries of cyclists to demonstrate how bicycling infrastructure is a point of intersection as well as an active site for making democratic claims to the Andean city.},

Since little is known about how differences in walking and cycling translate into inequalities in health benefits on the population level, this study quantified these health benefits for demographic and socioeconomic groups in the Netherlands. Population-representative data on walking and cycling among adults (aged 20\textendash 90 years) for the period 2010\textendash 2014 were analyzed with the Health Economic Assessment Tool (HEAT). Results showed pronounced differences between subgroups, with women, senior citizens (50\textendash 79 years), higher socioeconomic groups, and native-Dutch people walking and cycling more than others. Given the relatively high mortality rates and high levels of walking and cycling among senior citizens, it was found that a large number of deaths were prevented in that age group. In lower socioeconomic groups, despite their lower walking and cycling levels, it was found that even more deaths were prevented, given their large population size and higher mortality rates. The proportion of health benefits was found to be greater among the native Dutch because their walking and cycling levels as well as their population size were higher than among non-native groups. The study suggests that policies to increase walking and cycling among lower socioeconomic groups could induce further health benefits in the aggregate and thus help mitigate socioeconomic health inequalities.},

  abstract = {Human mobility and, in particular, commuting patterns have a fundamental role in understanding socio-economic systems. Analysing and modelling the networks formed by commuters, for example, has become a crucial requirement in studying rural areas dynamics and to help decision-making. This paper presents a simple spatial interaction commuting model with only one parameter. The proposed algorithm considers each individual who wants to commute, starting from their residence to all the possible workplaces. The algorithm decides the location of the workplace following the classical rule inspired from the gravity law consisting of a compromise between the job offers and the distance to the job. The further away the job is, the more important the offer should be to be considered for the decision. Inversely, the quantity of offers is not important for the decision when these offers are close by. The presented model provides a simple, yet powerful approach to simulate realistic distributions of commuters for empirical studies with limited data availability. The paper also presents a comparative analysis of the structure of the commuting networks of the four European regions to which we apply our model. The model is calibrated and validated on these regions. The results from the analysis show that the model is very efficient in reproducing most of the statistical properties of the network given by the data sources.},

We investigated whether female commuter cyclists were more likely to use bicycle routes that provide separation from motor vehicle traffic. Methods. Census of cyclists observed at 15 locations (including off-road bicycle paths, on-road lanes and roads with no bicycle facilities) within a 7.4~km radius of the central business district (CBD) of Melbourne, Australia, during peak commuting times in February 2004. Results. 6589 cyclists were observed, comprising 5229 males (79.4\%) and 1360 females (20.6\%). After adjustment for distance of the bicycle facility from the CBD, females showed a preference for using off-road paths rather than roads with no bicycle facilities (odds ratio [OR] = 1.43, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.12, 1.83), or roads with on-road bicycle lanes (OR = 1.34, 95\% CI: 1.03, 1.75). Conclusions. Consistent with gender differences in risk aversion, female commuter cyclists preferred to use routes with maximum separation from motorized traffic. Improved cycling infrastructure in the form of bicycle paths and lanes that provide a high degree of separation from motor traffic is likely to be important for increasing transportation cycling amongst under-represented population groups such as women.},

  abstract = {Objective To assess whether higher mortality rates among individuals in motor vehicle crashes in areas with low population density depend on injury type and severity or are related to the performance of emergency medical services (EMS). Methods Prehospital and hospital deaths were studied in a population-based cohort of 41 243 motor vehicle crashes that occurred in Sweden between 1998 and 2004. The final multivariable analysis was restricted to 6884 individuals in motor vehicle crashes, to minimise the effects of confounding factors. Results Crude mortality rates following motor vehicle crashes were inversely related to regional population density. In regions with low population density, the unadjusted rate ratio for prehospital death was 2.2 (95\% CI 1.9 to 2.5) and for hospital death 1.5 (95\% CI 1.1 to 1.9), compared with a high-density population. However, after controlling for regional differences in age, gender and the type/severity of injuries among 6884 individuals in motor vehicle crashes, low population density was no longer associated with increased mortality. At 25 years of age, predicted prehospital mortality was 9\% lower (95\% CI 5\% to 12\%) in regions with low population density compared with high population density. This difference decreased with increasing age, but was still 3\% lower (95\% CI 0.5\% to 5\%) at 65 years of age. Conclusions The inverse relationship between population density and mortality among individuals in motor vehicle crashes is related to pre-crash factors that influence the type and severity of injuries and not to differences in EMS.},

I consider the benefits of participatory planning and show how my prototype of a PSS can contribute to its success. To that end, the functionality of this PSS is described in the context of the initial experience with its application in a diversity of planning circumstances. Some conclusions are then drawn on how a PSS can overcome some of the barriers to GIS support within planning practice.},

  abstract = {For various reasons, it is important, if not essential, to integrate the computations and code used in data analyses, methodological descriptions, simulations, etc. with the documents that describe and rely on them. This integration allows readers to both verify and adapt the statements in the documents. Authors can easily reproduce them in the future, and they can present the document's contents in a different medium, e.g. with interactive controls. This paper describes a software framework for authoring and distributing these integrated, dynamic documents that contain text, code, data, and any auxiliary content needed to recreate the computations. The documents are dynamic in that the contents, including figures, tables, etc., can be recalculated each time a view of the document is generated. Our model treats a dynamic document as a master or ``source'' document from which one can generate different views in the form of traditional, derived documents for different audiences. We introduce the concept of a compendium as both a container for the different elements that make up the document and its computations (i.e. text, code, data, ...), and as a means for distributing, managing and updating the collection. The step from disseminating analyses via a compendium to reproducible research is a small one. By reproducible research, we mean research papers with accompanying software tools that allow the reader to directly reproduce the results and employ the methods that are presented in the research paper. Some of the issues involved in paradigms for the production, distribution and use of such reproducible research are discussed.},

  abstract = {The public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) research agenda has explored the issue of equitable access and use of geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial data among traditionally marginalized citizens, in order to facilitate effective citizen participation in inner-city revitalization activities. However, prior research indicates that PPGIS is a complex process, with uneven outcomes. The author contends that such unevenness can be explained by use of a new theoretical framework drawn from the literature of politics of scale and networks. The author contends that the PPGIS process occurs in `spaces of dependence', containing localized social relations and place-specific conditions. The politics of securing this space leads to the creation of `spaces of engagement' at multiple scales. Within these spaces, networks of association evolve to connect multiple actors from public and private sectors with community organizations. Such networks can contain structural inequities, hierarchical dominance, and fluctuating resources. But these networks also transcend political boundaries and are dynamic and flexible, enabling individuals to manipulate and modify them. In trying to control the revitalization agendas and the material resources required, the actors and community organizations construct politics of scale. For some community organizations, such scalar politics and creative alliances with critical actors allow them to navigate territorially scaled networks of power skillfully in order to gain an effective voice in decisionmaking activities. But other community organizations lag behind, and are not able to form relationships in order to secure their urban space. By the use of new empirical data, coupled with a new theoretical framework, the author aims to contribute both to greater theorization and to better understanding of the uneven and contradictory nature of PPGIS processes.},

Following the principle that effective access to information leads to better government as well as to community empowerment, this paper explores the issues of providing equitable access to GIS at the grass-roots level. The paper discusses a university/community partnership with the distressed, inner city neighborhood of Metcalfe Park in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In this project, the members of an inner-city neighborhood organization were given training in GIS for accessing public information, creating new databases from their own surveys, and analyzing these databases, with the purpose of making them able and active adjuncts to the conduct of city management and the formation of public policy. The paper evaluates the successes and failures of the project. It also explores the nature of GIS usage in this resource poor community organization between 1993\textendash 2000.},

  abstract = {Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a technique increasingly used in a broad range of social sciences. It involves building a computational model consisting of ``agents,'' each of which represents an actor in the social world, and an "environment" in which the agents act. Agents are able to interact with each other and are programmed to be pro-active, autonomous and able to perceive their virtual world. The techniques of ABM are derived from artificial intelligence and computer science, but are now being developed independently in research centers throughout the world.In Agent-Based Models, Nigel Gilbert reviews a range of examples of agent-based modeling, describes how to design and build your own models, and considers practical issues such as verification, validation, planning a modeling project, and how to structure a scholarly article reporting the results of agent-based modeling. It includes a glossary, an annotated list of resources, advice on which programming environment to use when creating agent-based models, and a worked, step-by-step example of the development of an ABM.This latest volume in the SAGE Quantitative Applications in the Social Sciences series will have wide appeal in the social sciences, including the disciplines of sociology, economics, social psychology, geography, economic history, science studies, and environmental studies. It is appropriate for graduate students, researchers and academics in these fields, for both those wanting to keep up with new developments in their fields and those who are considering using ABM for their research.Key FeaturesAimed at readers who are new to ABMOffers a brief, but thorough, treatment of a cutting-edge techniqueOffers practical advice about how to design and create ABMIncludes carefully chosen examples from different disciplines},

Now, more than ever, the prospect of rising costs puts continuation of this transport dependence in question. Costs could rise significantly due to the needs to reduce pollution, reverse urban sprawl, enhance security and, above all, use fuel that will become dramatically more expensive than those used now. This book sets out the challenges that will soon threaten modern society's dependence on low-cost transport in the light of the problems posed by oil supply and climate change. It proposes organizational and technical innovations that could ensure effective, secure movement of people and goods in ways that minimize environmental impacts and make the best use of renewable sources of energy. The authors conclude that transport in the first half of the 21st century will feature at least two revolutions. One will involve the use of electric drives rather than internal combustion engines. The other will involve powering these drives directly from the electric grid rather than from on-board fuel. The authors also address revolutions in marine transport and aviation and analyze the politics and business of transport and how these will undergo profound change in the decades ahead. This fresh look at the topic offers explanations, challenges the failures of governments and industry and proposes strategies and actions that can move transport towards sustainability.},

The authors argue that land transport in the first half of the 21st century will feature at least two revolutions. One will involve the use of electric drives rather than internal combustion engines. Another will involve powering many of these drives directly from the electric grid - as trains and trolley buses are powered today - rather than from on-board fuel. They go on to discuss marine transport, whose future is less clear, and aviation, which could see the most dramatic breaks from current practice.With its expert analysis of the politics and business of transport, Transport Revolutions is essential reading for professionals and students in transport, energy, town planning and public policy.},

Consequently, the underlying supply chains have become more and more complex to manage for the shipping companies, in terms of costs, distances, times, and environmental sustainability. SYNCHRO-NET, a H2020 European research project, aims to de-stress the international supply chains by fostering cost-effective and greener transportation alternatives. Besides other important actions, the SYNCHRO-NET framework provides an optimization and simulation toolset to support decision-making in freight logistics planning at a strategic level. The synchronized use of different transportation modes and the exploitation of smart steaming strategies for ship movements are the two main aspects considered in this innovative optimization system. In this paper, we present the optimization toolset developed, its contribution with respect to the existing platforms, and the experimental set-up implemented to evaluate its performance, usability, and effectiveness. The system is, in fact, currently under evaluation by several world-wide leading companies in freight logistics and transportation. However, the toolset potentialities go beyond the SYNCHRO-NET context, being the system an open-source project that makes use of open data formats and technologies.},

But over the twentieth century, the costs of moving these goods have declined by over 90\%in real terms, and there is little reason to doubt that this decline will continue. Moreover, technological change has eliminated the importance of fixed infrastructure transport (rail and water) that played a critical role in creating natural urban centres. In this article, we document this decline and explore several simple implications of a world where it is essentially free to move goods, but expensive to move people. We find empirical support for these implications. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {The effect of short-term aerobic exercise on vascular function of young individuals with a family history of hypertension was investigated. Thirty young men with a family history of hypertension were randomly assigned to either an exercise (n=15) or control (n=15) group. Exercise subjects performed 30 min of supervised cycle training at 65\% of their maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2max)), three times per week for 4 weeks. Control subjects were asked to maintain their normal levels of physical activity. Peak leg and forearm blood flow were assessed using plethysmography and was determined as the highest blood flow following 5 min of reactive hyperemia. Cardiopulmonary baroreceptor (CPBR) sensitivity was measured using lower body negative pressure (LBNP) for 5 min at -20 mm Hg. CPBR was determined by calculating change of stroke volume and forearm vascular resistance at baseline and during LBNP. Carotid baroreceptor (CBR) sensitivity was assessed using neck suction at -20, -40, -60 and -80 mm Hg pressures, and was determined from RR interval divided by systolic blood pressure. Augmentation index (AIx), a measure of arterial stiffness, was assessed using applanation tonometry and was calculated as the ratio of augmented pressure and pulse pressure. The major findings were that the exercise group showed increase in leg vasodilation, reduction in AIx and increase in VO(2max) compared with the control group (P{$<$}0.05). However, there was no significant change for CPBR and CBR. A short-term moderate-intensity aerobic exercise intervention in young men with a family history of hypertension significantly reduced arterial stiffness and increased aerobic fitness.},

The tool allows the user to analyze disparities in accessibility outcomes by demographic group, specifically income and race, as required by civil rights-related planning directives. The tool makes cumulative-opportunity measures of the number of essential destinations reachable within certain times by public transit and automobile. The tool is constructed to analyze the San Francisco Bay Area's 2005 regional transportation plan. Users can choose to make measures for a particular neighborhood or for all neighborhoods in the region with certain demographic characteristics.

  abstract = {Background Cycling to school has large potential health benefits, ensuring children get regular daily exercise. This paper demonstrates and implements a method for estimating the potential for modal switch to cycling for the school commute down to the route network level across England. Methods Input data from the 2011 School Census, provided by the English Department for Education, comprised two main tables: a school-level dataset representing 21,523 educational institutions and an origin-destination (OD) level dataset, containing around 50 desire lines per school. The method focused on the 1.37 million secondary school children (age 11-18) travelling less than 15km to school. For each of the 134,274 OD pairs we route distance and hilliness were estimated using the CycleStreets.net routing service. Current and potential levels of cycling were modeled as a function of distance and hilliness. This included using Dutch National Travel Survey to create a 'Go Dutch' scenario English children cycled as much as children in the Netherlands, accounting for route distance and hilliness. Results Among those travelling less than 15km, the current percentage of children cycling to school in England is 2.7\%. Our model of cycling potential highlights areas and routes with particularly high cycling potential, to help prioritize investment in safe routes to school. The scenarios show the scale of transformation possible in school travel patterns: 'Going Dutch' would see over two-thirds of these children cycle to school, approaching the level observed in The Netherlands, higher than the 27\% cycle mode share in an equivalent 'Go Dutch' scenario for cycling to work, implying that the potential uptake of cycling for travel to school could be even higher, as a percentage of trips, than the potential for cycling to work. Conclusions This paper highlights the very high potential of school trips to be cycled and suggest it should be a priority target for health-conscious transport policy. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a national database on school travel at the level has been analysed from a 'safe routes to school' perspective at high geographical resolution, down to the route network level. The methods could be deployed in other settings where travel to school data is available at the OD level to inform investments in safe routes to school, where they are most needed.},

  abstract = {Car use is associated with substantial health and environmental costs but research in deprived populations indicates that car access may also promote psychosocial well-being within car-oriented environments. This mixed-method (quantitative and qualitative) study examined this issue in a more affluent setting, investigating the socio-economic structure of car commuting in Cambridge, UK. Our analyses involved integrating self-reported questionnaire data from 1142 participants in the Commuting and Health in Cambridge study (collected in 2009) and in-depth interviews with 50 participants (collected 2009\textendash 2010). Even in Britain's leading `cycling city', cars were a key resource in bridging the gap between individuals' desires and their circumstances. This applied both to long-term life goals such as home ownership and to shorter-term challenges such as illness. Yet car commuting was also subject to constraints, with rush hour traffic pushing drivers to start work earlier and with restrictions on, or charges for, workplace parking pushing drivers towards multimodal journeys (e.g. driving to a `park-and-ride' site then walking). These patterns of car commuting were socio-economically structured in several ways. First, the gradient of housing costs made living near Cambridge more expensive, affecting who could `afford' to cycle and perhaps making cycling the more salient local marker of Bourdieu's class distinction. Nevertheless, cars were generally affordable in this relatively affluent, highly-educated population, reducing the barrier which distance posed to labour-force participation. Finally, having the option of starting work early required flexible hours, a form of job control which in Britain is more common among higher occupational classes. Following a social model of disability, we conclude that socio-economic advantage can make car-oriented environments less disabling via both greater affluence and greater job control, and in ways manifested across the full socio-economic range. This suggests the importance of combining individual-level `healthy travel' interventions with measures aimed at creating travel environments in which all social groups can pursue healthy and satisfying lives.},

  abstract = {Cycling confers transport, health and environmental benefits, and bicycle sharing systems are an increasingly popular means of promoting urban cycling. Following the launch of the London bicycle sharing system (LBSS) in 2010, women and residents of deprived areas were under-represented among initial users. This paper examines how the profile of users has changed across the scheme's first 3 years, using total-population registration and usage data. We find that women still make fewer than 20\% of all 'registered-use' LBSS trips, although evidence from elsewhere suggests that the introduction of 'casual' use has encouraged a higher overall female share of trips. The proportion of trips by registered users from 'highly-deprived areas' (in the top tenth nationally for income deprivation) rose from 6\% to 12\%. This was due not only to the 2012 LBSS extension to some of London's poorest areas, but also to a steadily increasing share of trips by residents of highly-deprived areas in the original LBSS zone. Indirect evidence suggests, however, that the twofold increase in LBSS prices in January 2013 has disproportionately discouraged casual-use trips among residents of poorer areas. We conclude that residents in deprived areas can and do use bicycle sharing systems if these are built in their local areas, and may do so progressively more over time, but only if the schemes remain affordable relative to other modes.},

Substantial inequalities are found in relation to gender, age, disability, and ethnicity for both types of cycling. For gender and age, and perhaps for disability in relation to recreational cycling, inequalities are moderated by local cycling prevalence such that English authorities with more cycling see less inequality. For education and car ownership, the picture is more mixed. Individuals with higher educational levels are more likely to participate in leisure cycling, but within most English local authorities this association is absent for utility cycling. Car ownership is negatively associated with utility cycling, but positively associated with recreational cycling. The paper's discussion section puts these inequalities in context, and discusses the significance of the fact that some inequalities seem to be less pronounced or even absent in some contexts. It is argued that more research and a broader conceptualisation of cycling inequalities are needed to better understand and address inequalities in cycling participation.},

  abstract = {Bicycle sharing systems are increasingly popular around the world and have the potential to increase the visibility of people cycling in everyday clothing. This may in turn help normalise the image of cycling, and reduce perceptions that cycling is 'risky' or 'only for sporty people'. This paper sought to compare the use of specialist cycling clothing between users of the London bicycle sharing system (LBSS) and cyclists using personal bicycles. To do this, we observed 3594 people on bicycles at 35 randomly-selected locations across central and inner London. The 592 LBSS users were much less likely to wear helmets (16\% vs. 64\% among personal-bicycle cyclists), high-visibility clothes (11\% vs. 35\%) and sports clothes (2\% vs. 25\%). In total, 79\% of LBSS users wore none of these types of specialist cycling clothing, as compared to only 30\% of personal-bicycle cyclists. This was true of male and female LBSS cyclists alike (all p{$>$} 0.25 for interaction). We conclude that bicycle sharing systems may not only encourage cycling directly, by providing bicycles to rent, but also indirectly, by increasing the number and diversity of cycling 'role models' visible.

  abstract = {Background The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) is a freely available, interactive tool help prioritise cycling initially launched in England in 2017 and based on adult commuting data. This paper applies the method to travel to school data, and assesses health and carbon benefits based on nationwide scenarios of cycling uptake. Methods The 2011 National School Census provides origin-destination data for all state-funded schools in England (N = 7,442,532 children aged 2\textendash 18 in 21,443 schools). Using this dataset, we modelled propensity to cycle as a function of route distance and hilliness between home and school. We generated scenarios, including `Go Dutch' \textendash{} in which English children were as likely to cycle as Dutch children, accounting for trip distance and hilliness. We estimated changes in the level of cycling, walking, and driving, and associated impacts on physical activity and carbon emissions. Results In 2011, 1.8\% of children cycled to school (1.0\% in primary school, 2.7\% in secondary school). If Dutch levels of cycling were reached, under the Go Dutch scenario, this would rise to 41.0\%, a 22-fold increase. This is larger than the 6-fold increase in Go Dutch for adult commuting. This would increase total physical activity among pupils by 57\%, and reduce transport-related carbon emissions by 81 kilotonnes/year. These impacts would be substantially larger in secondary schools than primary schools (a 96\% vs. 9\% increase in physical activity, respectively). Conclusion Cycling to school is uncommon in England compared with other Northern European countries. Trip distances and hilliness alone cannot explain the difference, suggesting substantial unmet potential. We show that policies resulting in substantial uptake of cycling to school would have important health and environmental benefits. At the level of road networks, the results can inform local investment in safe routes to school to help realise these potential benefits.},

Methods 1849 adults completed questionnaires in 2010 and 2011, before and after the construction of walking and cycling infrastructure in three UK municipalities. 1510 adults completed questionnaires in 2010 and 2012. The 2010 questionnaire measured baseline characteristics; the follow-up questionnaires captured infrastructure use. Results 32\% of participants reported using the new infrastructure in 2011, and 38\% in 2012. Walking for recreation was by far the most common use. In both follow-up waves, use was independently predicted by higher baseline walking and cycling (e.g. 2012 adjusted rate ratio 2.09 (95\% CI 1.55, 2.81) for \&gt; 450 min/week vs. none). Moreover, there was strong specificity by mode and purpose, e.g. baseline walking for recreation specifically predicted walking for recreation on the infrastructure. Other independent predictors included living near the infrastructure, better general health and higher education or income. Conclusions The new infrastructure was well-used by local adults, and this was sustained over two years. Thus far, however, the infrastructure may primarily have attracted existing walkers and cyclists, and may have catered more to the socio-economically advantaged. This may limit its impacts on population health and health equity.},

It concludes that there is now little doubt that young peoples' car use has reduced, but there is still doubt about how younger people will travel as they age, or how the next generation will travel; that location and settlement density effects are very important, meaning that future population distributions will be significant; and that while economic' factors are still seen to be important, elasticities with respect to price and income are falling, with signs of differential responses by population categories and location. In policy terms, it concludes that with the current level of uncertainty about future car use levels, rather than developing policy based on one forecast, we should be developing policy for a range of plausible scenarios.},

OBJECTIVE In a nationally representative cohort, we sought to assess the geographic and social distribution of PA facilities and how disparity in access might underlie population-level PA and overweight patterns. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Residential locations of US adolescents in wave I (1994-1995) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N = 20745) were geocoded, and a 8.05-km buffer around each residence was drawn (N = 42857 census-block groups [19\% of US block groups]). PA facilities, measured by national databases and satellite data, were linked with Geographic Information Systems technology to each respondent. Logistic-regression analyses tested the relationship of PA-related facilities with block-group socioeconomic status (SES) (at the community level) and the subsequent association of facilities with overweight and PA (at the individual level), controlling for population density. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Outcome measures were overweight (BMI \textbackslash textgreater or = 95th percentile of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Center for Health Statistics growth curves) and achievement of \textbackslash textgreater or = 5 bouts per week of moderate-vigorous PA. RESULTS Higher-SES block groups had a significantly greater relative odds of having 1 or more facilities. Low-SES and high-minority block groups were less likely to have facilities. Relative to zero facilities per block group, an increasing number of facilities was associated with decreased overweight and increased relative odds of achieving \textbackslash textgreater or = 5 bouts per week of moderate-vigorous PA. CONCLUSIONS Lower-SES and high-minority block groups had reduced access to facilities, which in turn was associated with decreased PA and increased overweight. Inequality in availability of PA facilities may contribute to ethnic and SES disparities in PA and overweight patterns.},

  abstract = {Mobility growth poses considerable challenges to city planners around the world, as it entails problems of congestion, air pollution, and accidents. Many cities have thus sought to increase the share of sustainable transport, and specifically travel by bicycle. However, it appears that measures to foster cycling are often implemented on an ad hoc basis, lacking strategic focus and a more profound understanding of bicycle cultures. New insights can be gained from Copenhagen, Denmark, a selfdeclared City of Cyclists that has made considerable progress towards increasing the share of travel by bicycle, with the political goal to become the "world's best city for bicycling". In this article, the success, reproducibility and limitations of the Copenhagen bicycle strategy are discussed in an urban transport transitions framework, based on a content- and discourse analysis of the city's official documents to assess the respective role of market-based, command-and-control, and soft policy measures in encouraging bicycling. Results suggest that soft policies, integrated with command-and-control measures, and the consideration of bicyclist expectations and concerns with regard to perceptions of safety, speed and comfort have been key in achieving high bicycle trip shares. Integrating these in comprehensive planning frameworks appears to be an approach that is more likely to foster bicycle cultures that can result in urban transport transitions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aims to quantify the population health impacts of differences between four settings. Method The Integrated Transport and Health Model (ITHIM) was used to estimate health impacts from changes to physical activity that would arise if adults in urban areas in England and Wales adopted travel patterns of Switzerland, the Netherlands, and California. The model was parameterised with data from travel surveys from each setting and estimated using Monte Carlo simulation. Two types of scenarios were created, one in which the total travel time budget was assumed to be fixed and one where total travel times varied. Results Substantial population health benefits would accrue if people in England and Wales gained as much transport related physical activity as people in Switzerland or the Netherlands, whilst smaller but still considerable harms would occur if active travel fell to the level seen in California.

  abstract = {Thirty years ago, Adams (1981) depicted a future UK where everyone was a millionaire lorry driver, simply by extrapolating from contemporary official transport growth assumptions. These assumptions underpinned the `predict and provide' approach which then characterised transport planning. Twenty years later, the New Deal for Transport White Paper (1998) abandoned `predict and provide' as unsustainable. This paper argues that the same growth assumptions that Adams took to their logical (absurd) conclusion have re-emerged to define both transport and the drivers of transport demand. While non-aviation transport is supposed to be carbon-neutral by 2050, the implied reductions in emissions rely on an absolute decoupling of transport demand and its drivers for which there is no evidence in current planning. Targets rely on optimistic, narrowly framed technology forecasts and behaviour change assumptions which appear highly unlikely in the present socio-political climate. Moreover, such is the cost of mitigating these tensions between economic growth and other concerns, it is argued that the targeted outcomes of current policy are as undesirable as they are unlikely. The paper concludes by calling for a transport policy which considers mobility in an integrated, holistic fashion, rather than merely as a dimension of economic growth.},

Using longitudinal data, it traces health changes over time for a variety of groups and through a variety of labour market experiences: during sustained employment and unemployment, in the transition from school to employment and unemployment, and as people move between employment and unemployment and between satisfying and unsatisfying jobs. The results show that employed people report significantly lower levels of health disorder than students and the unemployed. These differences are largely unaffected by demographic attributes, living arrangements, socioeconomic status or immediate labour market experiences, and can be attributed to employment status itself rather than predisposing health differences. However, the health consequences of employment and unemployment are directly contingent upon quality of work. As a result, the highest levels of health risk are found amongst dissatisfied workers and the lowest levels amongst satisfied workers. In between these two extremes lie employed people neither satisfied nor dissatisfied with their jobs, unemployed people irrespective of duration, and students. These results indicate that what happens in the workplace has even more impact on a person's health than success or failure in finding a job and keeping it.},

Interventions to change transport behaviour, and especially to reduce car use, could reduce CO2 emissions from road transport more quickly than technological measures. It is unclear, however, which interventions are effective in reducing car use and what the likely impact of these interventions would be on CO2 emissions. A two-stage systematic search was conducted focusing on reviews published since 2000 and primary intervention evaluations referenced therein. Sixty-nine reviews were considered and 47 primary evaluations found. These reported 77 intervention evaluations, including measures of car-use reduction. Evaluations of interventions varied widely in the methods they employed and the outcomes measures they reported. It was not possible to synthesise the findings using meta-analysis. Overall, the evidence base was found to be weak. Only 12 of the 77 evaluations were judged to be methodologically strong, and only half of these found that the intervention being evaluated reduced car use. A number of intervention approaches were identified as potentially effective but, given the small number of methodologically strong studies, it is difficult to draw robust conclusions from current evidence. More methodologically sound research is needed in this area.},

We analyse how the incentives of geo-games  might increase urban cycling engagement and, through this engagement, crowdsource cycling data collection and comprehend  cycling patterns. We designed a between-groups experiment to measure the impact of virtual rewards provided by a geo-game  on the levels of intention, satisfaction, and engagement with cycling. Then, to identify the frictions which potentially inhibit  bicycle commuting, we analysed the bicycle trips crowdsourced with the geo-game.The results support the use of  collaboration-based rewards in game-based applications to promote urban cycling and describe 284 places potentially having  frictions in three European cities. This thesis encompasses the cyclist and city perspectives of using mobile technologies to  crowdsource cycling data collection and analyse urban cycling.},

The present study demonstrates the usefulness of eigenfunctions in spatial modeling applied to ecological problems and shows equivalencies of and differences between the two current implementations of this methodology. The two approaches in this category are the distance-based (DB) eigenvector maps proposed by P. Legendre and his colleagues, and spatial filtering based upon geographic connectivity matrices (i.e., topology-based; CB) developed by D. A. Griffith and his colleagues. In both cases, the goal is to create spatial predictors that can be easily incorporated into conventional regression models. One important advantage of these two approaches over any other spatial approach is that they provide a flexible tool that allows the full range of general and generalized linear modeling theory to be applied to ecological and geographical problems in the presence of nonzero spatial autocorrelation.},

We have systematically evaluated existing uses of the \{ODD\} protocol and identified, as expected, parts of \{ODD\} needing improvement and clarification. Accordingly, we revise the definition of \{ODD\} to clarify aspects of the original version and thereby facilitate future standardization of \{ABM\} descriptions. We discuss frequently raised critiques in \{ODD\} but also two emerging, and unanticipated, benefits: \{ODD\} improves the rigorous formulation of models and helps make the theoretical foundations of large models more visible. Although the protocol was designed for ABMs, it can help with documenting any large, complex model, alleviating some general objections against such models.},

  abstract = {Many cities across the world are actively promoting cycling through investments in cycling infrastructure, yet ensuring that the benefits from these investments are distributed equally in a region and not benefiting only one group is an important social goal. The aim of this study is to develop a methodology that can help in identifying where new bicycle facilities can be built in a region while prioritizing investments for those who need them most. The study uses Quebec City, Canada, as an example since the city has recently made a strong commitment to provide safe and attractive bicycle infrastructure to its residents. It also uses a GIS-based grid cell model to identify priority areas for cycling investment in different parts of the city. This is followed by a proposal for a new set of facilities based on a multi-criteria approach. These proposed facilities are then evaluated through a level of usage analysis to determine which routes will provide the maximum benefit to existing and potential cyclists. Finally, an equity analysis is conducted to evaluate whether the new facilities will meet some of the travel needs of individuals residing in socially deprived neighborhoods. This step in the evaluation process proposes a new social equity component in bicycle planning processes. This research can be of value to planners, engineers and policymakers working toward investments in bicycle facilities because it shows the full process of planning and evaluating different cycling facilities while incorporating social equity principles.},

  abstract = {Several forms of renewable energy compete for supremacy or for an appropriate role in global energy supply. A form of renewable energy can only play an important role in global energy supply if it fulfills several basic requirements. Its capacity must allow supplying a considerable fraction of present and future energy demand, all materials for its production must be readily available, land demand must not be prohibitive, and prices must reach grid parity in the nearer future. Moreover, a renewable energy technology can only be acceptable if it is politically safe. We supply a collection of indicators which allow assessing competing forms of renewable energy and elucidate why surprise is still a major factor in this field, calling for adaptive management. Photovoltaics (PV) are used as an example of a renewable energy source that looks highly promising, possibly supplemented by solar thermal electricity production (ST). We also show why energy use will contribute to land use problems and discuss ways in which the right choice of renewables may be indispensible in solving these problems.},

  abstract = {The introduction in 2007 of a new public transport system in Santiago, Chile, brought to us an unexpected gift: the availability of Big Data; massive amounts of passive data obtained from technological devices installed to control the operation of buses and to administer the fare collection process. Many other cities in the world have experienced the same, and sooner or later, this is likely to happen everywhere. Seeing this opportunity, many researchers have developed tools to obtain valuable information from the available data. However, the case of Transantiago is particularly advantageous because all buses have GPS devices and the smart card presents an overall 97\% penetration rate. We describe a successful experience of collaboration between academia and the public transport authority to develop tools based on passive data processing. We include a brief description of the Transantiago system and the agreements made to develop the aforementioned tools. We also describe the methods developed to obtain valuable information like public transport trips origin-destination matrices, speed profiles of buses and service quality indicators, among others. Several examples of specific uses of the information for public transport policy and planning in Santiago are presented. The paper concludes with a discussion of what else can be obtained from this data and why we believe that this can change the way we do transport planning.},

  abstract = {Models belong to a wider family of knowledge technologies, applied in the transport area. Models sometimes share with other such technologies the fate of not being used as intended, or not at all. The result may be ill-conceived plans as well as wasted resources. Frequently, the blame for such a mismatch is put on irrational decision-making, or `politics', while still more energy is put into improving the models. These problems are not new, but seem persistent. It may be appropriate to re-read the symptoms, and consider new cures for disconnections between models and their uses. This paper applies critical analytic literature on knowledge utilization and policy influence. A simple scheme based in this literature is drawn up to provide a framework for discussing the interface between urban transport planning and model use. A successful example of model use in Stockholm, Sweden is used as a heuristic device to illuminate how such an analytic scheme may allow patterns of insight about the use, influence and role of models in planning to emerge. The main contribution of the paper is to demonstrate that concepts and terminologies from knowledge use literature can provide interpretations of significance for the simulation model area.},

We assessed data from the United States Bureau of the Census of Mineral Industries, the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the Oil and Gas Journal for the years 1919\textendash 2007 and from oil analyst Jean Laherrere to derive EROI for both finding and producing oil and gas. We found two general patterns in the relation of energy gains compared to energy costs: a gradual secular decrease in EROI and an inverse relation to drilling effort. EROI for finding oil and gas decreased exponentially from 1200:1 in 1919 to 5:1 in 2007. The EROI for production of the oil and gas industry was about 20:1 from 1919 to 1972, declined to about 8:1 in 1982 when peak drilling occurred, recovered to about 17:1 from 1986\textendash 2002 and declined sharply to about 11:1 in the mid to late 2000s. The slowly declining secular trend has been partly masked by changing effort: the lower the intensity of drilling, the higher the EROI compared to the secular trend. Fuel consumption within the oil and gas industry grew continuously from 1919 through the early 1980s, declined in the mid-1990s, and has increased recently, not surprisingly linked to the increased cost of finding and extracting oil.},

To date, the conventional approach to synthesizing the base-year population has been based on the iterative proportional fitting procedure. Two issues associated with this conventional approach are discussed: the first is often termed as the zero-cell-value problem, and the second is related to the inability to control for statistical distributions of both household- and individual-level attributes. Then, a new population synthesis procedure is presented that addresses the limitations of the conventional approach. The new procedure is implemented into an operational software system and used to generate synthetic populations for the Dallas-Fort Worth area in Texas. Validation results indicate that the new procedure can produce a synthetic population that more closely represents the true population than the conventional approach can.},

  abstract = {Shifting traffic to active transport modes (eg. walking/cycling) poses one of the most promising ways of tackling the persisting challenges that arise from motorized traffic. However, planning and policy making in walking and cycling domains is frequently impeded by a small-scaled and heterogeneous political landscape that rarely acts based on evidence thus limiting cost-effectiveness and target achievement. This paper proposes a largely data-driven planning approach that builds upon aggregated statistical models explaining walking and cycling modal shares. In addition to investigating a comprehensive set of influencing factors in relevant fields such as environment, climate, infrastructure or demographics, we bring attention to the role of political and administrative commitment in aggregated modal share modeling. Results suggest that our holistic approach is feasible both methodologically and in terms of its applicability in planning practice. As a first step towards evidence-based decision making the incremental effects of individual planning measures can be simulated and thus be used to rank options according to their effectiveness. Another outcome lies in the data-driven identification of spatial target areas for specific agenda setting in terms of awareness, mobility behavior, infrastructure, settlement structure and other planning-relevant domains.},

Recognising the necessary cost of renewable and energy efficient infrastructures, and the ever-present constraints on public funds, this paper argues that finance is a critical node through which local governments advance decarbonisation in urban localities. While local decarbonisation strategies have been viewed cautiously for their potential to overburden individuals at the expense of more systematic and organisational change, this paper reveals a more complex picture. Drawing on decarbonisation initiatives in two Melbourne municipalities\textemdash Moreland and Darebin\textemdash it identifies four ways in which local governments are using public finance to achieve their sustainability objectives. Local governments are brokering bulk product purchases for residents; lending upfront capital for solar PV via local property taxes; purchasing energy efficient products and funding innovative technology pilots; and procuring renewable energy supply through multi-stakeholder power purchase agreements. By targeting lower income households and pooling resources with other organisations, the paper shows that local governments can address socio-economic inequality and facilitate extra-local change towards a low-carbon city. However, these incremental achievements emphasise the need for co-ordination and state engagement to realise decarbonisation at a meaningful scale.},

  abstract = {The analysis of travel mode choice is an important task in transportation planning and policy making in order to understand and predict travel demands. While advances in machine learning have led to numerous powerful classifiers, their usefulness for modeling travel mode choice remains largely unexplored. Using extensive Dutch travel diary data from the years 2010 to 2012, enriched with variables on the built and natural environment as well as on weather conditions, this study compares the predictive performance of seven selected machine learning classifiers for travel mode choice analysis and makes recommendations for model selection. In addition, it addresses the importance of different variables and how they relate to different travel modes. The results show that random forest performs significantly better than any other of the investigated classifiers, including the commonly used multinomial logit model. While trip distance is found to be the most important variable, the importance of the other variables varies with classifiers and travel modes. The importance of the meteorological variables is highest for support vector machine, while temperature is particularly important for predicting bicycle and public transport trips. The results suggest that the analysis of variable importance with respect to the different classifiers and travel modes is essential for a better understanding and effective modeling of people's travel behavior.},

For modelling these objects of economic and commercial interactions standardized approaches are missing in Germany and abroad\textemdash there is a gap in the ``toolbox of traffic modelling''. There are several model ideas, but both the contracting authorities as well as the modellers in practice usually do not have an overview of the existing approaches, a recommendation of the aspects to be considered and named requirements, which economic transport models should achieve. In this contribution the requirements will be described and explained with reference to examples. The examples are taken from existing and hypothetical models for private and commercial transport.},

These users tend to have a diverse range of computer literacy, world views, cultural backgrounds and knowledge. These aspects require that the systems used within PPGIS are accessible and easy to use. Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and the related usability evaluation techniques focus on how to make computer systems more accessible, while focusing on user needs and requirements. Thus, the synergy between PPGIS and HCI seems natural. In this paper, we discuss the aspects of this synergy, building on our experience from three workshops. We demonstrate how usability evaluation can contribute to PPGIS research, and how PPGIS research can contribute to the HCI aspects of GIS in general. We conclude this paper with a call for a user-centred design approach to PPGIS projects.},

  abstract = {Economic production and, more generally, most global societies, are overwhelmingly dependant upon depleting supplies of fossil fuels. There is considerable concern amongst resource scientists, if not most economists, as to whether market signals or cost benefit analysis based on today's prices are sufficient to guide our decisions about our energy future. These suspicions and concerns were escalated during the oil price increase from 2005 \textendash{} 2008 and the subsequent but probably related market collapse of 2008. We believe that Energy Return On Investment (EROI) analysis provides a useful approach for examining disadvantages and advantages of different fuels and also offers the possibility to look into the future in ways that markets seem unable to do. The goal of this paper is to review the application of EROI theory to both natural and economic realms, and to assess preliminarily the minimum EROI that a society must attain from its energy exploitation to support continued economic activity and social function. In doing so we calculate herein a basic first attempt at the minimum EROI for current society and some of the consequences when that minimum is approached. The theory of the minimum EROI discussed here, which describes the somewhat obvious but nonetheless important idea that for any being or system to survive or grow it must gain substantially more energy than it uses in obtaining that energy, may be especially important. Thus any particular being or system must abide by a ``Law of Minimum EROI'', which we calculate for both oil and corn-based ethanol as about 3:1 at the mine-mouth/farm-gate. Since most biofuels have EROI's of less than 3:1 they must be subsidized by fossil fuels to be useful.},

The study was designed to explore the relationships between bicycle commuting and socio-demographic characteristics, individual attitudes, and the physical and social environments of the workplace. Results show that residential preference for a good environment for bicycling, a measure of self-selection, is associated with bicycle commuting. The physical environment, including a short distance to work, safe streets for bicycling, and high monthly parking costs around the workplace, is also important. The social environment of the workplace has an impact as well. This research provides an empirical basis for the development of policies and programs to increase bicycle commuting.},

In light of these benefits, a growing number of cities throughout the world are implementing policies to promote cycling, though they continue to struggle to identify the most effective ways to spend their limited resources. In response, transport researchers are also increasingly focusing their efforts on cycling, addressing a broader range of questions than in the past, including: how much cycling is there? What strategies will increase cycling? What are the benefits of increased cycling? This paper reviews the challenges that researchers face in providing answers to these questions by highlighting limitations of the existing research, identifying remaining research needs, and discussing methodological considerations for addressing those needs. Investments in cycling research can pay off by providing a basis for identifying the most effective strategies for increasing cycling and providing more accurate estimates of the benefits that would accrue.},

However, participants may submit low-quality, misleading, inaccurate, or even malicious data if a participatory sensing campaign is not launched effectively. Therefore, it has become a significant issue to establish an efficient participatory sensing campaign for improving the data quality. This article proposes a novel five-tier framework of participatory sensing and addresses several technical challenges in this proposed framework including: (1) optimized deployment of data collection points (DC-points); and (2) efficient recruitment strategy of participants. Toward this end, the deployment of DC-points is formulated as an optimization problem with maximum utilization of sensor and then a Wise-Dynamic DC-points Deployment (WD3) algorithm is designed for high-quality sensing. Furthermore, to guarantee the reliable sensing data collection and communication, a trajectory-based strategy for participant recruitment is proposed to enable campaign organizers to identify well-suited participants for data sensing based on a joint consideration of temporal availability, trust, and energy. Extensive experiments and performance analysis of the proposed framework and associated algorithms are conducted. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve a good sensing coverage with a smaller number of DC-points, and the participants that are termed as social sensors are easily selected, to evaluate the feasibility and extensibility of the proposed recruitment strategies.},

  abstract = {With its high cycling mode share, the Netherlands is often seen as a best practice for cycling policies. However, there is little insight into the drivers behind this phenomenon, specifically which policy interventions increased cycling rates and which did not. The knowledge gap on the effectiveness of cycling policies seriously limits the potential for learning from the Dutch experience. This paper will address this gap, by exploring the performance of Dutch cycling policies in 22 medium-sized cities since 2000. First, the existing ideas regarding the effectiveness of cycling policy are reviewed. These insights structure the exploration of data from Statistics Netherlands and the Dutch Cyclists' Union, complemented with a survey of local policy-makers by means of an explorative data-mining methodology called rough set analysis. Our findings support the following hypotheses regarding the performance of cycling policy in Dutch cities: first of all, the way cycling policy is implemented seems important: setting measurable and verifiable goals, following through with most of the proposed policy interventions, allowing for experimental measures to be explored and showing strong leadership. Second, providing adequate cycling infrastructure and decreasing the attractiveness of car use (e.g. by increasing parking tariffs and increasing the area of paid on-street car parking) seem to be key drivers. Finally, we found that external circumstances, such as demographic trends, seem to influence cycling policy outcomes. Future research is needed to test these hypotheses.},

Technological advances of modern society have contributed to a sedentary lifestyle that has changed the phenotype of children from that of 20 years ago. Children today weigh more and have a higher body mass index (BMI) than their peers of just a generation earlier (Ogden et al., 2012). Behaviorally, most children fail to engage in vigorous- or moderate-intensity physical activity for the recommended 60 minutes or more each day, with as many as one-third reporting no physical activity in the preceding 5 days (CDC, 2012). This lack of participation in physical activity has contributed to a greater prevalence of pediatric obesity, a decrease in fitness (e.g., flexibility, muscular strength, cardiorespiratory capacity), and a greater risk for disease (Boreham and Riddoch, 2001; Eisenmann, 2003; Malina, 2007; Steele et al., 2008).

This paper describes the three historical and disciplinary fields from which HIA has emerged \textemdash{} environmental health, a social view of health, and health equity. It also puts forward a typology of four different forms of HIA that can be observed in current HIA practice: mandated, decision-support, advocacy, and community-led HIAs.

Ten practice evaluation criteria derived from the Aarhus Convention are used to analyse the public participation procedures used in four UK waste disposal EIA case studies. The paper reports the extent to which the practice evaluation criteria were fulfilled, explores the types and effectiveness of the participation methods used in the EIAs, and highlights some of the key barriers that appear to impede the execution of `early' and `effective' participation programmes. It concludes that the Aarhus Convention will undoubtedly lead to a strengthening of participation procedures but that the level of improvement secured will depend upon how its ideals are interpreted and incorporated into legislation and practice.},

The analysis in this study reveals a steady growth of cycling related data in the OpenStreetMap platform over the past few years, rendering the data more complete and appropriate to be used as base map for planning studies on non-motorized transportation. A 10 comparison with the Google Maps Bicycling layer shows that the data quality of OpenStreetMap designated lanes is particularly high. OpenStreetMap bicycle trail data are somewhat more erroneous through missing data and incorrectly classified trails, however still of relatively good quality. For practical purposes it is recommended to check OpenStreetMap trail data against the Google Maps Bicycling layer before an analysis is conducted based on OpenStreetMap trail data.},

Incorrect measurements can result in accidents with fatal consequences. Therefore, high reliability and accuracy is a mandatory requirement. The performance of surround sensors depend on the ambient atmosphere and weather conditions. It is known that fog has a negative influence on wave propagation especially in the visible range. Hence, surround sensors must be tested under realistic conditions. To cope with this problem, this paper presents a novel setup together with a test methodology to investigate the influence of fog on automotive radar, lidar and camera sensors. Based on static indoor tests, we have shown that the measurements are consistent with literature and enable reproducible testing.},

  abstract = {Energy and Urban Built Form contains the papers that were presented at the International Seminar on Urban Built Form and Energy Analysis, held at Darwin College in Cambridge on June 26 and 27, 1986. The seminar focused on energy use in the built environment at an intermediate scale, between individual buildings and cities, where urban and architectural factors interact. It also covers the simulation and analysis of the performance of groups of buildings, from city blocks and industrial developments to mixed-use urban developments, housing estates, and stocks of buildings such as schools and houses. Organized into four parts encompassing 13 chapters, this volume describes techniques for calculating and minimizing energy consumption in groups of buildings, cities or entire regions. It first provides an overview of mathematical models, as well as approaches to the computation of the energy demand or energy-related properties of housing designs or groups of buildings. It then explores the politics of energy and the built environment, the mechanisms by which technical developments may be translated into effective action, and the energy efficiency of the urban built form. The reader is also introduced to passive solar scenarios for the UK domestic sector, intermediate-scale energy initiatives in the United Kingdom, thermal efficiency of building clusters, and glazed courtyards as an element of the low-energy city. This book is a valuable resource for city planners and engineers, scientists, and anyone interested in energy conservation.},

  abstract = {Road traffic injuries (RTIs) are a leading cause of morbidity, disability and mortality in less developed countries. Globally in 2002, 1.2 million deaths resulted from RTIs, and about 10 times that were injured. RTIs are often preventable, and the technology and knowledge to achieve success in this area exist. In spite of this, it is projected that given the current trend and without adequate intervention, RTIs will rank third of all major causes of morbidity and mortality globally by 2020. Although {$>$} 85\% of the global deaths and injuries from road traffic crashes occur in less developed countries, traffic safety attracts little public health attention in these nations, due in part to a plethora of other equally important problems, including infectious diseases. Unfortunately, the public health and economic impact of traffic-related injuries and disabilities can be incalculable in these countries, owing to their poorly developed trauma care systems and nonexistent social welfare infrastructures to accommodate the needs of the injured and the disabled. In this paper, we highlight the problem posed to public health in less developed countries by RTIs and examine contributing factors. To engender debate and action to address the problem, we reviewed interventions that have proven effective in industrialized nations and discussed potential barriers to their replication in less developed countries.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to model China's province-to-province migration flows using spatial interaction models. To date, conventional, gravity-type, spatial interaction models have typically employed information only on the number of movers and on the distances between places. This paper employs a new, multivariate approach to such interaction modeling by entering additional variables into the traditional modeling framework. In this particular application, two variables are added, namely, a measure of past migration, called migrant stock, and another measure of annual average total investment. The empirical verification of the models employs two interprovincial migration data sets for China. These involve the 1982-87 and 1985-90 migration flow data, consisting of two 28 \texttimes{} 28 data matrices. The results of the calibration show that the models with the additional variable(s) are capable of distributing migration flows with a much-improved degree of accuracy, in comparison with the conventional model. The calibration therefore provides empirical support for the validity of the multivariate approach to the spatial interaction modeling of migration flows.},

Existing clustering methods have mainly focused on the matching and clustering of complex trajectories. Few studies have paid attention to clustering origin-destination (OD) trips and discovering strong spatial linkages via OD lines, which is useful in many areas such as transportation, urban planning, and migration studies. In this paper, we present a new Simple Line Clustering Method (SLCM) that was designed to discover the strongest spatial linkage by searching for neighboring lines for every OD trip within a certain radius. This method adopts entropy theory and the probability distribution function for parameter selection to ensure significant clustering results. We demonstrate this method using bike-sharing location data in a metropolitan city. Results show that (1) the SLCM was significantly effective in discovering clusters at different scales, (2) results with the SLCM analysis confirmed known structures and discovered unknown structures, and (3) this approach can also be applied to other OD data to facilitate pattern extraction and structure understanding.},

Interest is growing in promoting utility cycling (i.e., for transport) as a means of incorporating daily physical activity (PA) into people's lives, but little is known about correlates of utility cycling. Our primary aim was to examine cross-sectional relationships between socio-economic characteristics, neighborhood environment perceptions and psychological disposition with utility cycling (with or without additional recreational cycling). A secondary aim was to compare these relationships with those for recreation-only cycling. Method. Baseline survey data (2007) from 10,233 participants in HABITAT, a multilevel longitudinal study of PA, sedentary behavior, and health in Brisbane adults aged 40\textendash 65 years, were analyzed using multinomial regression modeling. Results. Greater income, habitual PA, and positive beliefs about PA were associated with utility and recreationonly cycling (p b 0.05). Always having vehicle access and not in the labor force were associated with recreationonly cycling (p b 0.05). Some or no vehicle access, part-time employment, and perceived environmental factors (little crime, few cul-de-sacs, nearby transport and recreational destinations) were associated with utility cycling (p b 0.05). Conclusion. Our findings suggest differences in associations between socio-economic, neighborhood perceptions and psychological factors and utility and recreation-only cycling in Brisbane residents aged 40\textendash 65 years. Tailored approaches appear to be required to promote utility and recreational cycling.},

However, there has been limited evaluation of the impact of infrastructure investments. This study examined the behavioural impact of a new segment of a dedicated bikeway (Veloway 1 [V1] Stage C) that links southern suburbs with Brisbane city centre. The V1 Stage C opened in June, 2013. Cyclists who used a pre-existing shared path that links southern suburbs with the city centre completed an intercept survey pre- and post-V1 Stage C opening. Cyclists who used the V1 Stage C after it opened completed the same survey at the same time post-V1 Stage C opening. Survey data were complemented by GPS bicycle count data from cyclists riding on the main cycle routes into the city centre from southern suburbs: the V1 Stage C, the pre-existing shared path and a major arterial road. Survey data showed that pre- to post-V1 Stage C opening, average bicycle trip distance of cyclists using the shared path decreased (p=0.002), and the main catchment area of that path narrowed to suburbs to the west of it (p{$<$}0.001). Compared to cyclists using the shared path post-V1 Stage C opening, those using the V1 were travelling longer distances (p=0.02) and were more committed to making their trip by bicycle (p=0.001). The GPS bicycle counts increased monthly on the V1 Stage C after it opened (p{$<$}0.002). GPS bicycle counts on the alternative routes did not change (p=0.84). There were greater increases in monthly counts of cyclists approaching Brisbane from the south post-V1 Stage C opening than pre-opening. The findings suggest that veloways like the V1 can attract cyclists travelling from outer suburbs into a city centre.},

However, little is known about the detail of patterns of changes in travel behaviour. Adult commuters working in Cambridge (UK) completed annual questionnaires between 2009 and 2012. Commuting was assessed using a validated seven-day travel-to-work record. The intervention consisted of the opening of a guided busway with a path for walking and cycling in 2011. Exposure to the intervention was defined as the negative of the square root of the shortest road distance from home to the busway. We investigated the association between exposure to the intervention and specific modal shifts and patterns of change, along with individual mode choice patterns over the entire four-year period. Five groups of patterns of change were found in our in-depth explorations: (1) no change, (2) a full modal shift, (3) a partial modal shift, (4) non-stable but patterned behaviour, and (5) complicated or apparently random patterns. A minority of participants had a directed change of either a full modal shift or, more commonly, a partial modal shift, whereas a large proportion showed a highly variable pattern. No significant associations were found between exposure to the intervention and specific modal shifts or patterns of change. Our analyses revealed a large diversity in (changes in) travel behaviour patterns over time, and showed that the intervention did not result in one specific pattern of behaviour change or produce only full modal shifts. These insights are important for improving the measurement of travel behaviour, improving our understanding of how changes in travel behaviour patterns occur, and fully capturing the potential impacts of interventions.},

Aim To investigate whether exposure to a bicycle-sharing scheme\textemdash measured as residential proximity to a bicycle station\textemdash was associated with the propensity to use it. Second, we aimed to study the extent to which exposure to the scheme was associated with a change in time spent cycling. Method In this natural-experimental study, we analysed a large panel of residents in Brisbane, Australia, who were surveyed before and after the introduction of a bicycle-sharing scheme in 2010. Data were collected as part of the HABITAT study, a multilevel longitudinal investigation of physical activity and health among `baby boomers' (persons aged 40\textendash 65). Data were collected in 2009 (n = 7866), 2011 (n = 6900), and 2013 (n = 6520). Two self-reported outcome variables were examined: (1) a stages-of-change variable measuring the likelihood of using the scheme and the intention to use it in the future, and (2) change in time spent cycling between 2009 and 2013. Results In the unadjusted model, proximity was significantly associated with stages of change, but became non-significant after adjustment. Moreover, higher levels of exposure to the intervention did not predict a change in time spent cycling. Younger respondents and respondents with a higher education level were more likely to consider using the bicycle-sharing scheme. Individuals who had a college degree were more likely to have used this scheme. Conclusion Residential proximity to a bicycle-sharing station was not found to be associated with the use of the bicycle-sharing scheme nor did its introduction significantly predict an increase in time spent cycling. Other interventions may be more supportive of increasing cycling in the baby boomer cohort, and, thereby, improving their overall health.},

  abstract = {Ride-haling such as Uber and Lyft are changing the ways people travel. Despite widespread claims that these services help reduce driving, there is little research on this topic. This research paper uses a quasi-natural experiment in the Denver, Colorado, region to analyze basic impacts of ride-hailing on transportation efficiency in terms of deadheading, vehicle occupancy, mode replacement, and vehicle miles traveled (VMT). Realizing the difficulty in obtaining data directly from Uber and Lyft, we designed a quasi-natural experiment\textemdash by one of the authors driving for both companies\textemdash to collect primary data. This experiment uses an ethnographic and survey-based approach that allows the authors to gain access to exclusive data and real-time passenger feedback. The dataset includes actual travel attributes from 416 ride-hailing rides\textemdash Lyft, UberX, LyftLine, and UberPool\textemdash and travel behavior and socio-demographics from 311 passenger surveys. For this study, the conservative (lower end) percentage of deadheading miles from ride-hailing is 40.8\%. The average vehicle occupancy is 1.4 passengers per ride, while the distance weighted vehicle occupancy is 1.3 without accounting for deadheading and 0.8 when accounting deadheading. When accounting for mode replacement and issues such as driver deadheading, we estimate that ride-hailing leads to approximately 83.5\% more VMT than would have been driven had ride-hailing not existed. Although our data collection focused on the Denver region, these results provide insight into the impacts of ride-hailing.},

  abstract = {Plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) use in the United States (US) has doubled in recent years and is projected to continue increasing rapidly. This is especially true in California, which makes up nearly one-third of the current US PEV market. Planning and constructing the necessary infrastructure to support this projected increase requires insight into the optimal strategies for PEV battery recycling. Utilizing life-cycle perspectives in evaluating these supply chain networks is essential in fully understanding the environmental consequences of this infrastructure expansion. This study combined life-cycle assessment and geographic information systems (GIS) to analyze the energy, greenhouse gas (GHG), water use, and criteria air pollutant implications of end-of-life infrastructure networks for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in California. Multiple end-of-life scenarios were assessed, including hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical recycling processes. Using economic and environmental criteria, GIS modeling revealed optimal locations for battery dismantling and recycling facilities for in-state and out-of-state recycling scenarios. Results show that economic return on investment is likely to diminish if more than two in-state dismantling facilities are constructed. Using rail as well as truck transportation can substantially reduce transportation-related GHG emissions (23\textendash 45\%) for both in-state and out-of-state recycling scenarios. The results revealed that material recovery from pyrometallurgy can offset environmental burdens associated with LIB production, namely a 6\textendash 56\% reduction in primary energy demand and 23\% reduction in GHG emissions, when compared to virgin production. Incorporating human health damages from air emissions into the model indicated that Los Angeles and Kern Counties are most at risk in the infrastructure scale-up for in-state recycling due to their population density and proximity to the optimal location.},

Purpose of this guide is to assist you in producing quality maps by using fully-operational tools, without a need for serious additional investments. It will first introduce you the to the basic principles of geostatistical mapping and regression-kriging, as the key prediction technique, then it will guide you through four software packages: ILWIS GIS, R+gstat, SAGA GIS and Google Earth, which will be used to prepare the data, run analysis and make final layouts.

  abstract = {Random forest and similar Machine Learning techniques are already used to generate spatial predictions, but spatial location of points (geography) is often ignored in the modeling process. Spatial auto-correlation, especially if still existent in the cross-validation residuals, indicates that the predictions are maybe biased, and this is suboptimal. This paper presents a random forest for spatial predictions framework (RFsp) where buffer distances from observation points are used as explanatory variables, thus incorporating geographical proximity effects into the prediction process. The RFsp framework is illustrated with examples that use textbook datasets and apply spatial and spatio-temporal prediction to numeric, binary, categorical, multivariate and spatiotemporal variables. Performance of the RFsp framework is compared with the state-of-the-art kriging techniques using 5 \textendash{} fold cross-validation with refitting. The results show that RFsp can obtain equally accurate and unbiased predictions as different versions of kriging. Advantages of using RFsp over kriging are that it needs no rigid statistical assumptions about the distribution and stationarity of the target variable, it is more flexible towards incorporating, combining and extending covariates of different types, and it possibly yields more informative maps characterizing the prediction error. RFsp appears to be especially attractive for building multivariate spatial prediction models that can be used as "knowledge engines" in various geoscience fields. Some disadvantages of RFsp are the exponentially growing computational intensity with increase of calibration data and covariates, sensitivity of predictions to input data quality and extrapolation problems. The key to the success of the RFsp framework might be the training data quality \textemdash{} especially quality of spatial sampling (to minimize extrapolation problems and any type of bias in data), and quality of model validation (to ensure that accuracy is not effected by overfitting). For many data sets, especially those with fewer number of points and covariates and close-to-linear relationships, model-based geostatistics can still lead to more accurate predictions than RFsp.},

In the public transport setting, such contributions have, with rare exception, not been considered. In this paper, we discuss and empirically illustrate the merits of advanced modelling developments aimed at improving our understanding of public transport choice, namely the inclusion of reliability in extended expected utility theoretic forms, to recognize risk attitude and perceptual conditioning, the consideration of passenger crowding and its inclusion in linear additive models, and the role of multiple heuristics in representing attribute processing as a way of conditioning modal choice. We illustrate the mechanics of introducing these behaviourally appealing extensions using a modal choice data set collected in Sydney.},

This paper evaluates instruments aimed at a number of policy objectives linked to efficiency, sustainability and equity, focusing on social surplus gains in addition to cost effectiveness; but in particular the ability to reduce CO2. TRESIS, an integrated transport, land use and environmental strategy impact simulation pro- gram, is used to assess the influence on CO2 of a number of `at source' and `mitigation' instruments such as improvements in fuel efficiency, a carbon tax, variable user charges, and improvements in public transit.

But are these principles being applied in urban developments or are policy-makers following a 'path dependent' trajectory that severely limits the best practice outcomes sought? This review examines current research on path dependence to determine how this concept advances our understanding of barriers to change in the built environment, active transport and healthy communities. An online database search of scholarly bibliographic records identified 22 relevant articles for a critical review of studies that evaluated path dependence in the urban and built environment literature with a focus on transport, urban planning and health. A thematic analysis of the articles showed that different types of path dependence have contributed to the dominance of policies and designs supporting car-based transport to the detriment of public transport and active transport modes, leading to sub-optimal development patterns becoming 'locked-in'. However, the outcomes for active transport and physical activity are not all dire, and path dependence theory does provide some guidance on changing policy to achieve better outcomes. This review suggests that path dependence is one of the best theoretical frameworks to help health promoters understand barriers to change and can provide insights into developing future successful public health interventions. Future studies could focus further on active transport, local neighbourhood development and physical activity.},

The study follows a backcasting study approach, developing a business as usual baseline for transport emissions, and two alternative scenarios to 2030. Different policy measures are assessed and assembled into mutually supporting policy packages (PP). Although 2030 seems a long way ahead, action must be taken now if the targets for CO2 reduction are to be met. The achievement of a carbon-efficient transport future, combined with holding travel levels at present levels, is likely to be very difficult.

The transport sector in particular is finding it difficult to reduce CO2 emissions. This paper reports on two studies carried out by the authors in London (UK) and Delhi (India). It considers the common objectives for transport CO2 reduction, but the very different contexts and baselines, potentials for change, and some possible synergies. Different packages of measures are selected and scenarios developed for each context which are consistent with contraction and convergence objectives. CO2 reduction potentials are modelled and quantified by package and scenario. London is considering deep reductions on current transport CO2 emission levels; Delhi is seeking to break the huge projected rise in transport CO2 emissions. The scale of policy intervention required to achieve these goals is huge and there is certainly little public discussion of the magnitude of the changes required. The paper argues for a `strategic conversation' at the city level, using scenario analysis, to discuss the priorities for intervention in delivering low carbon transport futures. A greater focus is required in developing participatory approaches to decision making, alongside network investments, urban planning, low emission vehicles and wider initiatives. Aspirations towards equitable target emissions may assist in setting sufficiently demanding targets. Only then is a wider awareness and ownership of potential carbon efficient transport futures likely to take place.},

In 2007, humankind was able to store 2.9 \texttimes{} 10(20) optimally compressed bytes, communicate almost 2 \texttimes{} 10(21) bytes, and carry out 6.4 \texttimes{} 10(18) instructions per second on general-purpose computers. General-purpose computing capacity grew at an annual rate of 58\%. The world's capacity for bidirectional telecommunication grew at 28\% per year, closely followed by the increase in globally stored information (23\%). Humankind's capacity for unidirectional information diffusion through broadcasting channels has experienced comparatively modest annual growth (6\%). Telecommunication has been dominated by digital technologies since 1990 (99.9\% in digital format in 2007), and the majority of our technological memory has been in digital format since the early 2000s (94\% digital in 2007).},

While universities possess many resources that can facilitate such mitigation efforts, their potential contribution has been underexplored in academic literature. This article presents methods and results from a local-scale emissions inventory and mitigation planning process carried out in Pennsylvania's Centre Region by Penn State researchers. The inventory used innovative methods to estimate vehicle emissions and generate alternative local emissions scenarios. The mitigation planning process drew upon local knowledge of residents e who were informed by the emissions inventory e to generate and prioritize mitigation options they viewed as appropriate for the region. The publicly vetted options were presented to the regional government as a planning tool. Rather than create a single greenhouse gas mitigation plan for the region, the governing body decided each municipality should create its own energy-efficiency action plan based on its particular abilities and needs. This case study shows that politicians ultimately determine local climate change policy, but universities can play a valuable role in facilitating the process that leads to that policy. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Across all four cities we identified increases in bicycle lanes, off-road trails, and bus transit service, with spatial clustering in these changes that related to neighborhood sociodemographics. Overall, we found evidence of positive changes in physical infrastructure commonly identified as supportive of physical activity. However, the patterning of infrastructure change by sociodemographic change encourages attention to the equity in infrastructure improvements across neighborhoods.},

  abstract = {We described three uses of energy for which greater efficiency is feasible: transportation, space heating, and air conditioning. Shifts to less energy-intensive transportation modes could substantially reduce energy consumption; the magnitude of such savings would, of course, depend on the extent of such shifts and possible load factor changes. The hypothetical transportation scenario described here results in a 22 percent savings in energy for transportation in 1970, a savings of 2800 trillion Btu. To the homeowner, increasing the amount of building insulation and, in some cases, adding storm windows would reduce energy consumption and provide monetary savings. If all homes in 1970 had the "economic optimum" amount of insulation, energy consumption for residential heating would have been 42 percent less than if the homes were insulated to meet the pre-1971 FHA standards, a savings of 3100 trillion Btu. Increased utilization of energy-efficient air conditioners and of building insulation would provide significant energy savings and help to reduce peak power demands during the summer. A 67 percent increase in energy efficiency for room air conditioners would have saved 15.8 billion kilowatt-hours in 1970. In conclusion, it is possible-from an engineering point of view-to effect considerable energy savings in the United States. Increases in the efficiency of energy use would provide desired end results with smaller energy inputs. Such measures will not reduce the level of energy consumption, but they could slow energy growth rates.},

DESIGN: Four-week randomized pilot study. SETTING: Controlled laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-two volunteers (28 men) participated. Seventeen \{median age 37 years [interquartile range (IQR) 34, 45], median body mass index [BMI] 29 kg/m [IQR 27, 31]\} were randomized to the E-Bike group and 15 [median age 43 years (IQR 38, 45), median BMI 28 kg/m (IQR 26, 29)] to the Bike group. INTERVENTIONS: Participants in both groups were instructed to use the bicycle allocated to them (e-bike or conventional bicycle) for an active commute to work in the Basel (Switzerland) area at a self-chosen speed on at least 3 days per week during the 4-week intervention period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak was assessed before and after the intervention in an all-out exercise test on a bicycle ergometer. RESULTS: V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak increased by an average of 3.6 mL/(kg{$\cdot$}min) [SD 3.6 mL/(kg{$\cdot$}min)] in the E-Bike group and by 2.2 mL/(kg{$\cdot$}min) [SD 3.5 mL/(kg{$\cdot$}min)] in the Bike group, with an adjusted difference between the 2 groups of 1.4 mL/(kg{$\cdot$}min) [95\% confidence interval, -1.4-4.1; P = 0.327]. CONCLUSIONS: E-bikes may have the potential to improve cardiorespiratory fitness similar to conventional bicycles despite the available power assist, as they enable higher biking speeds and greater elevation gain.},

The existence of several types of so-called PPPs, and motives for them, is noted, as are criticism of loose assumptions about them in the debates. The argument then focuses on private finance initiative (PFI) schemes as one branch of cross-sectoral mixing arrangements, and examines the benefits and costs of using this mechanism. The conclusion is a pessimistic one: in the PFI arrangement, the potential for the interests of the advocating government and the business partners to dominate over the public interest has been palpable. There is an urgent need to explore further the merit of these infrastructure `partnerships' to ensure that they do advance the public interest.},

Establishment of a course toward such stabilization will require the development within the coming decades of primary energy sources that do not emit carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, in addition to efforts to reduce end-use energy demand. Mid-century primary power requirements that are free of carbon dioxide emissions could be several times what we now derive from fossil fuels (approximately 10(13) watts), even with improvements in energy efficiency. Here we survey possible future energy sources, evaluated for their capability to supply massive amounts of carbon emission-free energy and for their potential for large-scale commercialization. Possible candidates for primary energy sources include terrestrial solar and wind energy, solar power satellites, biomass, nuclear fission, nuclear fusion, fission-fusion hybrids, and fossil fuels from which carbon has been sequestered. Non-primary power technologies that could contribute to climate stabilization include efficiency improvements, hydrogen production, storage and transport, superconducting global electric grids, and geoengineering. All of these approaches currently have severe deficiencies that limit their ability to stabilize global climate. We conclude that a broad range of intensive research and development is urgently needed to produce technological options that can allow both climate stabilization and economic development.},

  abstract = {In many U.S. metropolitan areas, bicycle advocates have been breathing sighs of relief as their elected officials join with them in fighting for bicycle facilities. No longer a battle between bicyclists and their government, the partnerships have blossomed into more than just bicycle paths. Through two case studies, we explore how politicians are exploiting the growing appeal of bicycle culture for economic development. In Los Angeles an open streets event, CicLAvia, brings together a diverse array of residents but politicians and local business owners celebrate it for its potential to increase downtown development. In Minneapolis, the city government appears to have used a popular off-street bicycle path to `clean up' areas of town and create prime real estate for luxury apartments. The city's mayor unabashedly connects his dedication to bicycle infrastructure to recruiting the `creative class' to Minneapolis. In this article we argue that advocates and policymakers who frame bicycle amenities as `creative class' bait ignore and potentially undermine bicycle mobility by those who do not fit into this desired group of citizens. Furthermore, conflating the practice of bicycling with specific urban development projects designed to accommodate it, limits what can be seen as `bike friendly' neighbourhoods and manufactures scarcity in what should be a public resource: urban streets.},

It is suitable for readers in any country.~ ~ The book is split into two parts. The first part is about the principles of transport modelling. This part talks about travel demand, transport networks, zones, trip matrices, the value of time, trip generation, mode split, destination choice, model calibration \textendash{} lots of scary words that need explaining in order to understand the role of models in the assessment of transport projects. All modes of transport are covered: cars, buses, trains, trucks, taxis, walking, cycling and others.

Main outcome was suffering an injury related to a cycling accident in last five years. 54.3\% of the sample reported a cycling accident resulting in injury. In multivariate adjusted models, accidents were associated with age (over 60׳s had lowest risk; OR: 0.61, 95\% CI, 0.47\textendash 0.78), gender (women lower risk than men; 0.86, 0.75\textendash 1.00), weekly cycling distance in a dose-dependent manner (\&gt;160 km/wk; 2.44, 2.02\textendash 2.94), cycling experience (curvilinear association), commuting (1.33, 1.17\textendash 1.51), use of various safety equipment, always stopping at red signals (0.86, 0.73\textendash 0.99), and regular use of minor roads as oppose to major roads (0.80, 0.68\textendash 0.94).

  abstract = {Recognizing the environmental and health benefits of cycling, cities around the world are promoting use of the bicycle for everyday transportation, but with limited information about the preferences of cyclists and the effectiveness of investments in bicycle infrastructure. To better understand the decision-making of cyclists, we estimated a route choice model with GPS data collected from smartphone users in San Francisco. Traces were automatically filtered for activities and mode transfers, and matched to a network model. Alternatives were extracted using repeated shortest path searches in which both link attributes and generalized cost coefficients were randomized. The prior distribution for the coefficients was calibrated automatically using only the network. A Path Size Multinomial Logit model revealed that bicycle lanes were preferred to other facility types, especially by infrequent cyclists. Steep slopes were disfavored, especially by women and during commutes. Other negative attributes included length and turns. Traffic volume, traffic speed, number of lanes, crime rates, and nightfall had no effect. Marginal rates of substitution imply a user benefit of bike lanes of \$0.61 USD per km per trip. Coefficients were applied to a trip assignment model that will be used to evaluate prospective investments in bicycle infrastructure in San Francisco.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The MATSim (Multi-Agent Transport Simulation) software project was started around 2006 with the goal of generating traffic and congestion patterns by following individual synthetic travelers through their daily or weekly activity programme. It has since then evolved from a collection of stand-alone C++ programs to an integrated Java-based framework which is publicly hosted, open-source available, automatically regression tested. It is currently used by about 40 groups throughout the world. This book takes stock of the current status.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The first part of the book gives an introduction to the most important concepts, with the intention of enabling a potential user to set up and run basic simulations.The second part of the book describes how the basic functionality can be extended, for example by adding schedule-based public transit, electric or autonomous cars, paratransit, or within-day replanning. For each extension, the text provides pointers to the additional documentation and to the code base. It is also discussed how people with appropriate Java programming skills can write their own extensions, and plug them into the MATSim core.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The project has started from the basic idea that traffic is a consequence of human behavior, and thus humans and their behavior should be the starting point of all modelling, and with the intuition that when simulations with 100 million particles are possible in computational physics, then behavior-oriented simulations with 10 million travelers should be possible in travel behavior research. The initial implementations thus combined concepts from computational physics and complex adaptive systems with concepts from travel behavior research. The third part of the book looks at theoretical concepts that are able to describe important aspects of the simulation system; for example, under certain conditions the code becomes a Monte Carlo engine sampling from a discrete choice model. Another important aspect is the interpretation of the MATSim score as utility in the microeconomic sense, opening up a connection to benefit cost analysis.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Finally, the book collects use cases as they have been undertaken with MATSim. All current users of MATSim were invited to submit their work, and many followed with sometimes crisp and short and sometimes longer contributions, always with pointers to additional references.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}We hope that the book will become an invitation to explore, to build and to extend agent-based modeling of travel behavior from the stable and well tested core of MATSim documented here.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

This study aims to use geo-tagged tweets to identify and visualize refugee migration patterns from the Middle East and Northern Africa to Europe during the initial surge of refugees aiming for Europe in 2015, which was caused by war and political and economic instability in those regions. The focus of this study is on exploratory data analysis, which includes refugee trajectory extraction and aggregation as well as the detection of topical clusters along migration routes using the V-Analytics toolkit. Results suggest that only few refugees use Twitter, limiting the number of extracted travel trajectories to Europe. Iterative exploration of filter parameters, dynamic result mapping, and content analysis were essential for the refinement of trajectory extraction and cluster detection. Whereas trajectory extraction suffers from data scarcity, hashtag-based topical clustering draws a clearer picture about general refugee routes and is able to find geographic areas of high tweet activities on refugee related topics. Identified spatio-temporal clusters can complement migration flow data published by international authorities, which typically come at the aggregated (e.g., national) level. The paper concludes with suggestions to address the scarcity of geo-tagged tweets in order to obtain more detailed results on refugee migration patterns.},

These classes and groups share most of the responsibility for the negative impacts of motor transport, and are often the least concerned about them.

Initially it considers recent UK government ideas on the integration of transport and land use planning, exploring how the concept has been located carefully in relation to both established and emerging debates about, for example, sustainability, mobility and structures of governance. The paper then moves on to consider the relationship between these concepts in EU transport discourse taking an example from Sweden of what an integrated urban transport policy might look like on the ground. The final section develops a model of integration and applies this analytic construct to assess integration practices and outcomes of urban mobility management at the local authority level in England. The research uncovers implementation failures including duplication of procedures, failures in communication and the lack of clear and resourced responsibilities.},

The paper first outlines the English policy context in terms of responsibilities, powers and resources available to local transport planners, and identifies the tools of government that can be more efficiently applied to effect a more sustainable transport system which specifically reduces CO2 emissions. A snapshot of transport decision-making in five local transport authorities in England is presented, using a case study methodology, which explores the joint working practices of practitioners in five public policy sectors that influence accessibility patterns. The case study highlights the norms and values of the local public administrators who affect local transport mobility and how they in turn are hindered both by the rigidity of central government direction and an insufficiency of implementation tools.},

A total of 1128 questionnaires were completed and returned by current cyclists. Each questionnaire presented a pair of possible bicycle use alternatives and asked which was preferred for travel to a hypothetical all-day meeting or gathering (business or social). Alternatives were described by specifying the amounts of time spent on three different types of cycling facility and whether or not showers and/or secure bicycle parking were available at the destination. Indications of socio-economic character and levels of experience and comfort regarding cycling were also collected. The observations thus obtained were used to estimate the parameter values for a range of different utility functions in logit models representing this choice behaviour. The results indicate, among other things, that time spent cycling in mixed traffic is more onerous than time spent cycling on bike lanes or bike paths; that secure parking is more important than showers at the destination; and that cycling times on roadways tend to become less onerous as level of experience increases. Some of these results are novel and others are consistent with findings regarding bicycle use in work done by others, which is seen to add credence to this work. A review of previous findings concerning influences on cycling behaviour is also included.},

  abstract = {Introduction Traffic volume and urban air quality has not improved in Scotland in recent years. The aim of this study was to investigate the barriers and incentives to reducing the risk of traffic-related air pollution and protecting physical and general wellbeing. Method Semi-structure interviews where held with professionals from the key environmental organisations involved in policy, planning, implementation and lobbying for improvements in air quality. Results The most frequent barrier identified was the lack of integrated planning between housing developments \textendash{} shopping \textendash{} schools - employment centres \textendash{} and transport systems (e.g. roads, footpaths, cycle lanes, public transport options). The next most frequent barrier was the lack of personal or business choices that might facilitate an increase in active and public transport uptake. Almost as important was the perceived lack of understanding amongst the public about the health risks associated with air pollution, and the lack of voice for vulnerable people, particularly children. The top three incentives for change mirrored the key barriers with proposals for subsidising public transport and coordinating services to make it a more feasible option; improve public understanding; and address the planning and infrastructure fragmentation. Conclusion A lack of progress in reducing air pollution may be related to the invisibility of the problem both in health and economic terms. There is a disconnect between planning and development priorities at a national and local level which means vehicular transport is still the most efficient and cost effective option for personal and business transport. What is needed is political commitment to align policies and use both hard (punitive) measures and soft (behaviour choice) measures to reduce traffic-related air pollution in urban areas and protect and improve health. To address this real time, linked air pollution and health impact information must be made widely available.},

Based on historical data from January 2010 till October 2019, a forecasting model is implemented in order to set a reference baseline. Making use of airplane movements extracted from online flight tracking platforms and on-line booking systems, this study presents also a first assessment of recent changes in flight activity around the world as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. To study the effects of air travel ban on aviation and in turn its socio-economic, several scenarios are constructed based on past pandemic crisis and the observed flight volumes. It turns out that, according to this hypothetical scenarios, in the first Quarter of 2020 the impact of aviation losses could have negatively reduced World GDP by 0.02\% to 0.12\% according to the observed data and, in the worst case scenarios, at the end of 2020 the loss could be as high as 1.41-1.67\% and job losses may reach the value of 25-30 millions. Focusing on EU27, the GDP loss may amount to 1.66-1.98\% by the end of 2020 and the number of job losses from 4.2 to 5 millions in the worst case scenarios. Some countries will be more affected than others in the short run and most European airlines companies will suffer from the travel ban.},

The method consists in filter speed and accelerations, assign buffers to the road network, aggregate speed by street, fill missing number of lanes, generate traffic flow. Methods presented here were used to inform traffic-related air quality modelling and used as part of local air pollution management activities but are also amenable to any work that would be enhanced by more locally representative or time-resolved inputs for traffic flow, e.g. traffic network management, and demand modelling. \textbullet 124 million GPS observations from electronic devices were used to generate traffic flow.\textbullet Spatial bias was investigated and accounted for using independent local traffic count data.\textbullet Traffic count rescaled GPS traffic flow provide a robust description of spatial and quantitative traffic patterns.},

Therefore, their quality is fundamental for the accuracy of crash analyses and, consequently the design of effective countermeasures. Although crash data often suffer from correctness and completeness issues, these are rarely discussed or addressed in crash analyses. Crash reports aim to answer the five ``W'' questions (i.e. When?, Where?, What?, Who? and Why?) of each crash by including a range of attributes. This paper reviews current literature on the state of crash data quality for each of these questions separately. The most serious data quality issues appear to be: inaccuracies in crash location and time, difficulties in data linkage (e.g. with traffic data) due to inconsistencies in databases, severity misclassification, inaccuracies and incompleteness of involved users' demographics and inaccurate identification of crash contributory factors. It is shown that the extent and the severity of data quality issues are not equal between attributes and the level of impact in road safety analyses is not yet entirely known. This paper highlights areas that require further research and provides some suggestions for the development of intelligent crash reporting systems.},

Nor, indeed, is there any acknowledgement of the experiences and needs of disabled cyclists in policy, practice or the public imagination. Nonetheless, cycling is a key form of mobility for people with disabilities, and cycling facilitates autonomy and independence of movement for many disabled people, as well as providing health-promoting physical activity. Drawing from qualitative interviews, this paper explores this gap in the context of the deficit model of disability and its impacts upon people with physical disabilities who cycle, many of whom who use their cycle as their main form of transport and mobility. It highlights the barriers that disabled cyclists face in terms of mobility, accessing cycling and the perceptions and attitudes which impede their everyday activities and underpin exclusionary policy, practice and infrastructure. Rejecting the deficit model of disability and recognising cycling as a key strength/ability for people with physical disabilities will lead to greater equality and improve the lives and experiences of disabled people.},

A distinction is made between the relative accessibility between two points and the integral, or total, accessibility at a point. Secondly, various operational forms of these definitions are illustrated with reference to the Hamilton, Ontario, urban area. The derivation of the various measures that are developed is discussed.

In this general context, the paper explores the configuration of scientific citizenship and of the scientific citizen within policy and consultation processes. Building upon a detailed examination of one important social experiment - the Public Consultation on Developments in the Biosciences - the social construction of both science and public consultation is considered. With particular attention to the framing of issues for public debate, the constitution of audience and the construction of citizenship, the paper argues the need to move beyond mere sloganizing over science and democracy. The discussion concludes with a presentation of competing technologies of community and an assessment of their significance for the future practice of scientific citizenship.},

Using data from the two most recent waves of the World Values Survey (1999\textendash 2004, 2005\textendash 2009), this article seeks to explain this variance by means of a multilevel analysis of 79 countries. We include characteristics on the individual level, as age or gender, as well as aggregate variables linked to specificities of the nation-states. In particular, we focus on the religious denomination of a person and her religiosity to explain her attitude toward homosexuality. We find clear differences in levels of homonegativity among the followers of the individual religions.},

  abstract = {Objective: To examine the relationship between the numbers of people walking or bicycling and the frequency of collisions between motorists and walkers or bicyclists. The common wisdom holds that the number of collisions varies directly with the amount of walking and bicycling. However, three published analyses of collision rates at specific intersections found a non-linear relationship, such that collisions rates declined with increases in the numbers of people walking or bicycling. Data: This paper uses five additional data sets (three population level and two time series) to compare the amount of walking or bicycling and the injuries incurring in collisions with motor vehicles. Results: The likelihood that a given person walking or bicycling will be struck by a motorist varies inversely with the amount of walking or bicycling. This pattern is consistent across communities of varying size, from specific intersections to cities and countries, and across time periods. Discussion: This result is unexpected. Since it is unlikely that the people walking and bicycling become more cautious if their numbers are larger, it indicates that the behavior of motorists controls the likelihood of collisions with people walking and bicycling. It appears that motorists adjust their behavior in the presence of people walking and bicycling. There is an urgent need for further exploration of the human factors controlling motorist behavior in the presence of people walking and bicycling. Conclusion: A motorist is less likely to collide with a person walking and bicycling if more people walk or bicycle. Policies that increase the numbers of people walking and bicycling appear to be an effective route to improving the safety of people walking and bicycling.},

Method: Review of the literature of medical, public health, city planning, public administration and traffic engineering. RESULTS: The real and perceived danger and discomfort imposed by traffic discourage walking and bicycling. Accurately or not, pedestrians and bicyclists judge injury risk and respond accordingly. Although it can be difficult to measure these effects, observed behaviour provides good evidence for these effects, with the strongest association being an inverse correlation between volumes and speeds of traffic and levels of walking and cycling. CONCLUSION: Interventions to reduce traffic speed and volume are likely to promote walking and bicycling and thus result in public health gains.},

  abstract = {Recent years saw a continuing shift in labour force composition, e.g. greater participation of women and a prominent rise in part-time workers. There are as yet relatively few recent studies that examine systematically the influences on the travel of employed adults from such perspectives, particularly regarding possible transport disadvantages of the fastest growing segments of workers. A robust analysis requires systematic data on a wide range of explanatory variables and multiple travel outcomes including accessibility, mobility and trip frequency for different trip purposes. The UK NTS data does meet the majority of this demanding data requirement, but its full use has so far been hampered by methodological difficulties. To overcome complex endogeneity problems, we develop novel, integrated structural equation models (SEMs) to uncover the influences of latent land use characteristics, indirect influences on car ownership, interactions among trip purposes as well as residents' self-selection and spatial sorting. This general-purpose method provides a new, systematic decomposition of the influences on travel outcomes, where the effects of each variable can be examined in turn with robust error terms. The new insights underline two direct policy implications. First, it highlights the contributions of land use planning and urban design in restraining travel demand in the 2000s, and their increasing influence over the decade. Secondly, it shows that there may still be a large mobility disadvantage among the fastest growing segments of workers, particularly in dense urban areas. This research further investigates trend breaking influences before and after 2007 through grouped SEM models, as a test of the methodology for producing regular and timely updates regarding the main influences on personal travel from a system level.},

In economic terms the cost of unemployment, both to the individual and to the collective, is extremely high. But unemployment has other effects too. In this book Marie Jahoda looks beyond the obvious economic consequences, to explore the psychological meaning of employment and unemployment. The book is an accessible and nontechnical account of the contribution which social psychology can make to understanding unemployment and clearly reveals the limitations of an exclusive concentration on its economic aspects. Professor Jahoda shows that the psychological impact is hugely destructive, throwing doubt on the popular diagnosis that the work ethic is disappearing. She also analyses the experience of unemployment in the context of the experience of employment and argues that one of the socially destructive consequences of large-scale unemployment is that it detracts from the need to humanise employment.},

This book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. Since the goal of this textbook is to facilitate the use of these statistical learning techniques by practitioners in science, industry, and other fields, each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in R, an extremely popular open source statistical software platform.Two of the authors co-wrote The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman, 2nd edition 2009), a popular reference book for statistics and machine learning researchers. An Introduction to Statistical Learning covers many of the same topics, but at a level accessible to a much broader audience. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. The text assumes only a previous course in linear regression and no knowledge of matrix algebra.},

Within the last years, these measures have been extended and reused to measure semantic similarity; i.e., for comparing meanings rather than syntactic differences. Various measures for spatial applications have been de- veloped, but a solid foundation for answering what they measure; how they are best applied in information retrieval; which role contextual information plays; and how similarity values or rankings should be interpreted is still missing. It is therefore difficult to decide which measure should be used for a particular application or to compare results fromdif- ferent similarity theories. Based on a review of existing similarity measures,we introduce a framework to specify the semantics of similarity. We discuss similarity-based information retrieval paradigms as well as their implementation in web-based user interfaces for geo- graphic information retrieval to demonstrate the applicability of the framework. Finally, we formulate open challenges for similarity research.},

Within 20 years, reductions in the prevalences of type 2 diabetes, dementia, ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and cancer because of increased physical activity would lead to savings of roughly UK\textsterling 17 billion (in 2010 prices) for the NHS, after adjustment for an increased risk of road traffic injuries. Further costs would be averted after 20 years. Sensitivity analyses show that results are invariably positive but sensitive to assumptions about time lag between the increase in active travel and changes in health outcomes.

  abstract = {Depicting a large number of points on a map may lead to overplotting and to a visual clutter. One of the widely accepted visualization methods that provides a good overview of a spatial distribution of a large number of points is a heat map. Interactions for efficient data exploration, such as zooming, filtering or parameters' adjustments, are highly demanding on the heat map construction. This is true especially in the case of big data. In this paper, we focus on a novel approach of estimating the kernel density and heat map visualization by utilizing a graphical processing unit. We designed a web-based JavaScript library dedicated to heat map rendering and user interactions through WebGL. The designed library enables to render a heat map as an overlay over a background map provided by a third party API (e.g. Open Layers) in the scope of milliseconds, even for data size exceeding one million points. In order to validate our approach, we designed a demo application visualizing a car accident dataset in the Great Britain. The described solution proves fast rendering times (below 100 ms) even for dataset up to 1.5 million points and outperforms mainstream systems such as the Google Maps API, Leaflet heat map plugin or ESRI's ArcGIS online. Such performance enables interactive adjustments of the heat map parameters required by various domain experts. The described implementation is a part of the WebGLayer open source information visualization library.},

We show that these measures can be used for characterizing the structural properties of an urban street network, and for the selection of important streets. The proposed approach is validated by a case study applied to a middle-sized Swedish city.},

Building on previous studies, we propose a working hypothesis of personal risk perception and trip adjustment decision and collect information to preliminary check our hypothesis. We report on our work, and the results of an online survey carried out between March 12-19, 2020, which collected 71 responds from countries in Europe, Asia, Australia, and the Middle East in this working paper. Our results illustrate how the respondents altered their travel, their rationales, the precautionary actions they took, their foremost concerns, the sources of information they based their decisions on, and how useful they found teleconference as an alternative. Also, we observed their risk-related perception concerning the proposed model. We found several potential correlations and some regional and country variations but were unable to draw any definitive conclusion due to the limited sample size.

These models illustrate the characteristics and important variables to establish whether the public will use more paratransit in the future once improvements will have been made. Moreover, several models are developed to explore public perception in order to find out whether they agree to the replacement of paratransit with other types of transportation modes. All models are well fitting. These models are able to explain the respondents\^a characteristics and to reveal their actual perception of the operation of paratransit.

  abstract = {Objective: To introduce a conceptual structure that can be used to organise the evidence base for Health Impact Assessment (HIA). Background: HIA can be used to judge the potential health effects of a policy, programme or project on a population, and the distribution of those effects. Progress has been made in incorporating HIA into routine practice, especially (in the UK) at local level. However, these advances have mainly been restricted to process issues, including policy engagement and community involvement, while the evidence base has been relatively neglected. Relating policies to their impact on health: The key distinctive feature of HIA is that determinants of health are not taken as given, but rather as factors that themselves have determinants. Nine ways are distinguished in which evidence on health and its determinants can be related to policy, and examples are given from the literature. The most complete of these is an analysis of health effects in the context of a comparison of options. A simple model, the policy/risk assessment model (PRAM), is introduced as a framework that relates changes in levels of exposures or other risk factors to changes in health status. This approach allows a distinction to be made between the technical process of HIA and the political process of decision making, which involves lines of accountability. Extension of the PRAM model to complex policy areas and its adaptation to non-quantitative examples are discussed. Issues for the future: A sound evidence base is essential to the long term reputation of HIA. Research gaps are discussed, especially the need for evidence connecting policy options with changes in determinants of health. It is proposed that policy options could be considered as ``exposure'' variables in research. The methodology needs to be developed in the course of work on specific issues, concentrated in policy areas that are relatively tractable. Conclusions: A system of coordination needs to be established, at national or supranational level, building on existing initiatives. The framework suggested in this paper can be used to collate and evaluate what is already known, both to identify gaps where research is required and to enable an informed judgement to be made about the potential health impacts of policy options. These judgements should be made widely available for policy makers and for those undertaking health impact assessment.},

A transport model is used to single out data on commuting preferences in the County Stockholm. Our analysis shows there is a very large potential for reducing emissions and exposure if all car drivers living within a distance corresponding to a maximum of a 30min bicycle ride to work would change to commuting by bicycle. It would result in {$>$}111,000 new cyclists, corresponding to an increase of 209\% compared to the current situation. Mean population exposure would be reduced by about 7\% for both NOx and black carbon (BC) in the most densely populated area of the inner city of Stockholm. Applying a relative risk for NOx of 8\% decrease in all-cause mortality associated with a 10{$\mu$}gm-3 decrease in NOx, this corresponds to {$>$}449 (95\% CI: 340\textendash 558) years of life saved annually for the Stockholm county area with 2.1 million inhabitants. This is more than double the effect of the reduced mortality estimated for the introduction of congestion charge in Stockholm in 2006. Using NO2 or BC as indicator of health impacts, we obtain 395 (95\% CI: 172\textendash 617) and 185 (95\% CI: 158\textendash 209) years of life saved for the population, respectively. The calculated exposure of BC and its corresponding impacts on mortality are likely underestimated. With this in mind the estimates using NOx, NO2 and BC show quite similar health impacts considering the 95\% confidence intervals.},

It will be argued that deficiencies in the present road design philosophy are the main cause of the global road safety crisis, clearly indicating its man-made nature. A brief description is made of the decision process leading to the establishment of Vision Zero as Sweden's Traffic Safety Policy in 1997. Following an analysis of the problem, suggestions are made for finding solutions. The solutions are based on some of the principles in Vision Zero. They include a new basic mechanism for creating error-tolerance in the road system, and new design principles for road- and street design. The tradition of ``blaming the victim'' is hereby questioned and focus is put on the need for professionals to act based on these new standards. During the last 10 years the fatalities in Sweden have dropped from approximately 550/year to 450/year. Roads redesigned with median barriers have an 80\% reduction in fatalities. Streets with 30km/h design speed show similar results. This indicates that measures derived from Vision Zero strategy are effective but that large scale implementation has not yet been done.},

For instance, steep segments need to be avoided for energy-efficient routes and for routes that are suitable for mobility-restricted people. Such incline information may be derived from digital elevation models (DEMs). However, the corresponding data capturing methods (e.g. airborne LiDAR, photogrammetry, and terrestrial surveying) are expensive. Current low-cost and open-licensed DEM (e.g. Shuttle Radar Topography Mission [SRTM] and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer [ASTER]) generally do not have sufficient horizontal resolution or vertical accuracy, and lack a global coverage. Therefore, we have investigated an alternative low-cost approach which derives street incline values from GPS traces that have been voluntarily collected by the OpenStreetMap contributors. Despite the poor absolute accuracy of this data, the relative accuracy of traces seems to be sufficient enough to compute incline values with reasonable accuracy. A validation shows that the accuracy of incline values calculated from GPS traces slightly outperforms incline values derived from SRTM-1 DEM, though results depend on how many traces per street segment are used for computation.},

To remain active, and continue the physical and psychological benefits of physical fitness, people need options that support continued movement; one option is an electric bike. In this study we identified the characteristics of older people who own and ride an electric bike in Australian and understand their motivations for purchase, their electric bike use and safety issues. We conducted an online study of electric bike owners in Australia (n=529). In this analysis, we focused on responses from participants aged 65 years and older (n=69). Respondents were aged from 65 to 88 years (71 years), most were retired (73.9\%) and had been regular cyclists prior to purchasing an electric bike (80.3\%). Almost half (42.6\%) purchased their electric bike in a specialist electric bike shop and the two most reported motivations for purchase were to ride with less effort and replace car trips. The majority of respondents rode their electric bike weekly (88.0\%) including people who rode it daily (34.3\%). The most frequently cited mode shift was from private motor vehicle (car) to electric bike across all trip purposes. Respondents typically felt safer riding an electric bike than a pedal bike and the majority had not experienced an electric bike crash (84.1\%). This initial, exploratory study provides the first insights into older Australian electric bike riders. Electric bikes provide a fun, practical option for people to incorporate active travel into their most frequent trips. Mode shift from car trips suggest that electric bikes increase regular (weekly, daily) physical activity. Initiatives and public policies that support electric bike use may increase the uptake of electric bikes by older people in Australia.},

A naturalistic cycling study was conducted in Melbourne, Australia, with cyclists wearing helmet-mounted video cameras. Video recordings captured cyclists' perspective of the road and traffic behaviours including head checks, reactions and manoeuvres. The 100-car naturalistic driving study analysis technique was adapted for data analysis and events were classified by severity: collision, near-collision and incident. Participants were adult cyclists and each filmed 12 hours of commuter cycling trips over a 4-week period. In total, 127 hours and 38 minutes were analysed for 13 participants, 54 events were identified: 2 collisions, 6 near-collisions and 46 incidents. Prior to events, 88.9\% of cyclists travelled in a safe/legal manner. Sideswipe was the most frequent event type (40.7\%). Most events occurred at an intersection/intersection-related location (70.3\%). The vehicle driver was judged at fault in the majority of events (87.0\%) and no post-event driver reaction was observed (83.3\%). Cross tabulations revealed significant associations between event severity and: cyclist reaction, cyclist post-event manoeuvre, pre-event driver behaviour, other vehicle involved, driver reaction, visual obstruction, cyclist head check (left), event type and vehicle location (p{$<$}0.05). Frequent head checks suggest cyclists had high situational awareness and their reactive behaviour to driver actions led to successful avoidance of collisions/near-collisions. Strategies to improve driver awareness of on-road cyclists and to indicate early before turning/changing lanes when sharing the roadway with cyclists are discussed. Findings will contribute to the development of effective countermeasures to reduce cyclist trauma.},

  abstract = {Debate continues about the inter-relationships between human and physical geography and their different research and publication practices. Relatively little data about these are available, however. Using an analysis of all publications submitted by UK geographers to the 2001 Research Assessment Exercise, this paper identifies a substantial difference between human and physical geographers in their publication strategies. Most physical geographers place their research papers in specialized inter-disciplinary journals and make relatively little use of geography outlets: most human geographers, on the other hand, publish in geography journals. Comparisons with other disciplines - in the earth and environmental and social sciences respectively - also identify differences between geographers and their peers. The overall conclusion is that, with regard to research and publication at least, UK geography cannot be presented as a single academic community with strong internal ties, but rather as a conglomerate of separate communities writing for different audiences.},

There has been limited destination-focused quantitative analysis of how tourism might be reshaped to reduce these emissions. This paper uses an extended tourism environmental satellite account methodology to examine the case of tourism in Wales, a United Kingdom region. It shows how an estimate of the emissions associated with trips to, and in, the region - internally, from the rest of the UK and from abroad - can contribute to regional aspirations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The analysis suggests that substantial emissions cuts are dependent upon technical developments outside of tourism itself. Four potential scenarios are devised and analysed. Scenario 1 shows the value of low carbon electricity production in cutting tourism-related emissions. Scenario 2 analyses a possible 50\% fall in international arrivals and 10\% increase in UK domestic arrivals - maintaining employment but reducing emissions. Scenario 3 shows the effects of switch from private to public transport modes for 50\% of UK resident arrivals. Scenario 4 examines the outcomes of reducing ground transport emissions by using electric, biofuel and hybrid technologies. All scenarios cut emissions, none are highly effective and most are dependent on changes in society and governance.},

Based on an extensive review of the contemporary literature, we aim to clarify key concepts and definitions around the notion of social impacts, and to give them an identity distinct from economic and environmental impacts and from existing notions of `distributional issues'. We primarily focus on five short-term or `immediate' categories of social impact, namely accessibility, movement and activities, health-related, financial related and community-related impacts. We then consider the spatial, temporal and socio-demographic distributional effects of transport at every level of planning, policy and systems delivery. We also briefly discuss some of the longer-term social consequences of these social impacts in terms of health, individual and community wellbeing and social equity and justice. The paper is designed as an introduction to a wider discussion of these themes in this Special Issue Social Impacts and Equity Issues in Transport. Our overall aim for the paper is to demonstrate that, by overlooking the social impacts and social equity implications of transport decision-making at every level of the decision-making process, we are fundamentally undermining quality of life and social well-being in our towns, cities and rural settlements. Conversely, we believe that integration and consideration of the social impacts of transport planning and delivery can significantly increase the quality, effectiveness and efficiency of a number of other important areas of economic and social policy, including employment, health, education and economic development.},

In parallel, sophisticated tools have been developed to process, visualize and analyze tracking data, however many of these tools have proliferated in isolation, making it challenging for users to select the most appropriate method for the question in hand. Indeed, within the R software alone, we listed 58 packages created to deal with tracking data or 'tracking packages'. Here we reviewed and described each tracking package based on a workflow centered around tracking data (i.e. spatio-temporal locations (x,y,t)), broken down into three stages: pre-processing, post-processing and analysis, the latter consisting of data visualization, track description, path reconstruction, behavioral pattern identification, space use characterization, trajectory simulation and others. Supporting documentation is key to render a package accessible for users. Based on a user survey, we reviewed the quality of packages' documentation, and identified 11 packages with good or excellent documentation. Links between packages were assessed through a network graph analysis. Although a large group of packages showed some degree of connectivity (either depending on functions or suggesting the use of another tracking package), one third of the packages worked in isolation, reflecting a fragmentation in the R movement-ecology programming community. Finally, we provide recommendations for users when choosing packages, and for developers to maximize the usefulness of their contribution and strengthen the links within the programming community.},

  abstract = {A bicycle is a promising human-powered and emission-free transportation mode to address growing transportation and environmental problems. Bike-friendly environments should be constructed to innovatively increase the use of bicycles as a significant transportation mode. From this perspective, the scientific and effective monitoring of bicycling environments is of keen interest. An important technical challenge for monitoring is to evaluate the performance of bicycling environments. This study proposes a novel monitoring method that can be used for evaluating bicycle performance in terms of safety and mobility. An instrumented probe bicycle (IPB), which is equipped with a set of sensors including a global positioning systems (GPS) receiver, accelerometer, and gyro sensor, was used to develop the proposed monitoring method. The IPB provides useful bicycle maneuvering data for identifying longitudinal, lateral, and vertical maneuverings of the bicycle, which are affected by environmental factors such as heavy vehicle volume, surface conditions, grade, crossings, humps, and curbs. Regarding safety monitoring, an index to predict bicyclist's perceived safety and comfort with the predictors derived from the measurements by the IPB was developed. A questionnaire survey was conducted to obtain actual responses from bicyclists for perceived safety and comfort during the field experiment. In addition, a method to evaluate the bicycle mobility using GPS speed data was devised. Then, a fault tree analysis (FTA) technique, which is a well-known technique for risk analysis, was adopted to integrate safety and mobility monitoring. As a result, the bicycling monitoring index (BMI) was proposed. Data derived from the proposed method is expected to be effectively used for promoting the bicycle use by supporting the development and evaluation of various bicycle-related policies. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Based on the approach of 'arena of development' controversies over bioenergy in the shaping of a Danish climate strategy are analyzed as a contribution to a sustainable transition perspective on bioenergy in industrialized societies with substantial agricultural production. Bioenergy plays a prominent role in several Danish climate and energy plans, alongside with wind and solar energy, and energy savings. There are major controversies about targets for bioenergy with respect to acceptable types, sources and amounts of biomass. Strong path dependency is identified. Energy companies in Denmark convert coal fired power plants to biomass in order to sustain the role of these power plants. Their increasing use of imported wood pellets is criticized for increasing greenhouse gas emissions because of fast logging of years of forest growth. A Danish biotech company is developing enzymes for processing of biomass for biofuels. The alignment with the private car regime is strong, because biofuel enables continuation of fuel-driven vehicles as dominating transportation mode. Danish farmers see manure as important source for biogas while arguing for reduction of climate impact and nuisances from digested manure. Such biogas is questioned by some NGOs who fear manure-based biogas is used as argument for increased animal husbandry. The bioenergy controversies concern also methodologies for environmental assessments, including for indirect land use changes (ILUC), and reliability of certification schemes. The mapping of controversies identifies issues that probably need to be taken into account in shaping of Danish bioenergy strategies if these strategies should gain substantial legitimacy among environmental NGOs.},

The transferability of commuter trip-chaining behavior is also examined through comparison with results of a previous study conducted in Austin, Texas. Commuters engaged in many nonwork stops during commuting trips, indicating that trip chaining is an essential characteristic of commuting behavior. The analysis reveals that socioeconomic attributes, workplace conditions, and commuter preference exert similar influences in the two cities, whereas traffic system characteristics (namely, no-stop travel time) have different influences on morning stop frequency behavior in the two cities.

With PPGIS tools, residents' insight of their living environment can be reached and utilized along the planning process. The results are divided to conceptual and empirical points. Whereas the conceptual points emphasize better understanding of the locus of the PPGIS tools in planning process, the empirical findings reveal new ways to study how residents' perceptions align with the plan proposal. Though new tools, data and analysis can support representativeness, independence, early involvement, influence and transparency, planners and residents need more understanding of the benefits of these tools. The study indicates that though planners found the collected data and the analysis valuable, they still lacked the skills and institutional motivation to use the data effectively. The results point out that when PPGIS tools can be integrated to the mainstream planning practices, the tools have the ability to evolve to a more comprehensive participatory planning support system.},

Six years later (2005-2011), OpenStreetMap and Google Earth (GE) are now full-fledged, crowdsourced 'Wikipedias of the Earth' par excellence, with millions of users contributing their own layers to GE, attaching photos, videos, notes and even 3-D (three dimensional) models to locations in GE. From using Twitter in participatory sensing and bicycle-mounted sensors in pervasive environmental sensing, to creating a 100,000-sensor geo-mashup using Semantic Web technology, to the 3-D visualisation of indoor and outdoor surveillance data in real-time and the development of next-generation, collaborative natural user interfaces that will power the spatially-enabled public health and emergency situation rooms of the future, where sensor data and citizen reports can be triaged and acted upon in real-time by distributed teams of professionals, this paper offers a comprehensive state-of-the-art review of the overlapping domains of the Sensor Web, citizen sensing and 'human-in-the-loop sensing' in the era of the Mobile and Social Web, and the roles these domains can play in environmental and public health surveillance and crisis/disaster informatics. We provide an in-depth review of the key issues and trends in these areas, the challenges faced when reasoning and making decisions with real-time crowdsourced data (such as issues of information overload, "noise", misinformation, bias and trust), the core technologies and Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards involved (Sensor Web Enablement and Open GeoSMS), as well as a few outstanding project implementation examples from around the world.},

Increased combustion of fossil fuels in the last century is responsible for the progressive change in the atmospheric composition. Air pollutants, such as carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), ozone (O3), heavy metals, and respirable particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), differ in their chemical composition, reaction properties, emission, time of disintegration and ability to diffuse in long or short distances. Air pollution has both acute and chronic effects on human health, affecting a number of different systems and organs. It ranges from minor upper respiratory irritation to chronic respiratory and heart disease, lung cancer, acute respiratory infections in children and chronic bronchitis in adults, aggravating pre-existing heart and lung disease, or asthmatic attacks. In addition, short- and long-term exposures have also been linked with premature mortality and reduced life expectancy. These effects of air pollutants on human health and their mechanism of action are briefly discussed.},

Setting: The city of Melbourne, Australia. Participants: 2349 men and women residing in 50 areas (58.7\% response rate). Main outcome measure: Cycling for recreational purposes (at least once a month vs never). Design: In a cross-sectional survey participants reported their frequency of recreational cycling. Objective area characteristics were collected for their residential area by environmental audits or calculated with Geographic Information Systems software. Multilevel logistic regression models were performed to examine associations between recreational cycling, area socioeconomic level, compositional characteristics (age, sex, education, occupation) and area characteristics (design, safety, destinations or aesthetics). Results: After adjustment for compositional characteristics, residents of deprived areas were less likely to cycle for recreation (OR 0.66; 95\% CI 0.43 to 1.00), and significant between-area differences in recreational cycling were found (median odds ratio 1.48 (95\% credibility interval 1.24 to 1.78). Aesthetic characteristics tended to be worse in deprived areas and were the only group of area characteristics that explained some of the area deprivation differences. Safety characteristics explained the largest proportion of between-area variation in recreational cycling. Conclusion: Creating supportive environments with respect to safety and aesthetic area characteristics may decrease between-area differences and area deprivation inequalities in recreational cycling, respectively.},

  abstract = {The large fluctuations observed in the daily solar radiation profiles affect highly the reliability of the PV system sizing. Increasing the reliability of the PV system requires higher installed peak power (Pm) and larger battery storage capacity (CL). This leads to increased costs, and makes PV technology less competitive. This research paper presents a new stochastic simulation model for stand-alone PV systems, developed to determine the minimum installed Pm and CL for the PV system to be energy independent. The stochastic simulation model developed, makes use of knowledge acquired from an in-depth statistical analysis of the solar radiation data for the site, and simulates the energy delivered, the excess energy burnt, the load profiles and the state of charge of the battery system for the month the sizing is applied, and the PV system performance for the entire year. The simulation model provides the user with values for the autonomy factor d, simulating PV performance in order to determine the minimum Pm and CL depending on the requirements of the application, i.e. operation with critical or non-critical loads. The model makes use of NASA's Surface meteorology and Solar Energy database for the years 1990-2004 for various cities in Europe with a different climate. The results obtained with this new methodology indicate a substantial reduction in installed peak power and battery capacity, both for critical and non-critical operation, when compared to conventional approaches applied in PV sizing. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

In common with other data, it is not possible to know exactly how far from the truth socioeconomic data are. Therefore, when such data are used in a decision-making environment an approximate measure given for correctness of data is an essential component. This is illustrated, using choropleth mapping techniques on census data as an example. Both attribute and spatial uncertainty are considered, with Monte Carlo statistical simulations being used to model attribute uncertainty. An appropriate visualisation technique to manage certain choropleth issues and uncer-tainty in census type data is introduced, catering for attribute and spatial uncertainty simultaneously. This is done using the output from hierarchical spatial data structures, in particular the region quadtree and the HoR (Hexagon or Rhombus) quadtree. The variable cell size of these structures expresses uncertainty, with larger cell size indicating large uncertainty, and vice versa. This technique is illustrated using the New Zealand 2001 census data, and the TRUST (The Representation of Uncertainty using Scale-unspecific Tessellations) software suite, designed to show spatial and attribute uncertainty whilst simultaneously displaying the original data.},

Moreover, we have developed an ArcGIS tool to perform this protocol on OSM data, which we have applied to 80 urban areas in the world and made the results freely available. The tool accounts for crossover roads such as ramps and bridges. A separate tool is also made available for planar data and can be applied to any line features in ArcGIS.},

This study examines the immediate and long term effectiveness of advertising restrictions enacted in different countries on exposure to different forms of product marketing, and examines differences in exposure across different socioeconomic status (SES) groups. Nationally representative data from the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and the United States, collected from adult smokers between 2002 and 2008 using the International Tobacco Control Four Country Survey (ITC-4), were used in this study (N = 21,615). In light of the specific marketing regulation changes that occurred during the course of this study period, changes in awareness of tobacco marketing via various channels were assessed for each country, and for different SES groups within countries. Tobacco marketing regulations, once implemented, were associated with significant reductions in smokers' reported awareness of pro-smoking cues, and the observed reductions were greatest immediately following the enactment of regulations. Changes in reported awareness were generally the same across different SES groups, although some exceptions were noted. While tobacco marketing regulations have been effective in reducing exposure to certain types of product marketing there still remain gaps, especially with regard to in-store marketing and price promotions.},

  abstract = {Stream monitoring data provides insights into the biological, chemical and physical status of running waters. Additionally, it can be used to identify drivers of chemical or ecological water quality, to inform related management actions, and to forecast future conditions under land use and global change scenarios. Measurements from sites along the same stream may not be statistically independent, and the R package SSN provides a way to describe spatial autocorrelation when modelling relationships between measured variables and potential drivers. However, SSN requires the user to provide the stream network and sampling locations in a certain format. Likewise, other applications require catchment delineation and intersection of different spatial data. We developed the R package openSTARS that provides the functionality to derive stream networks from a digital elevation model, delineate stream catchments and intersect them with land use or other GIS data as potential predictors. Additionally, locations for model predictions can be generated automatically along the stream network. We present an example workflow of all data preparation steps. In a case study using data from water monitoring sites in Southern Germany, the resulting stream network and derived site characteristics matched those constructed using STARS, an ArcGIS custom toolbox. An advantage of openSTARS is that it relies on free and open-source GRASS GIS and R functions, unlike the original STARS toolbox which depends on proprietary ArcGIS. openSTARS also comes without a graphical user interface, to enhance reproducibility and reusability of the workflow, thereby harmonizing and simplifying the data pre-processing prior to statistical modelling. Overall, openSTARS facilitates the use of spatial regression and other applications on stream networks and contributes to reproducible science with applications in hydrology, environmental sciences and ecology.},

This approach dovetails with the emissions-target-focused approach that frames climate policy discussions around the world, avoids uncertainties in estimates of climate damages and long-term decarbonization costs, offers transparency about sensitivities and enables the consideration of CO2 prices alongside a portfolio of policies. We estimate illustrative NT2NZ CO2 prices for the United States; for a 2050 net-zero CO2 emission target, prices are US\$34 to US\$64 per metric ton in 2025 and US\$77 to US\$124 in 2030. These results are most influenced by assumptions about complementary policies and oil prices.},

  abstract = {Use of the private car is often viewed as highly problematic. It is regularly associated with global physical, social and ecological harms such as climate change and the high incidence of lifestyle diseases, including heart disease. Attempts to address these problems generally include provision for day-to-day physical mobility based on alternatives to the private car. Labelled alternative transport, these modes include public transport, walking and cycling. Yet the private car continues as the preferred way to travel in many cities. A deeper understanding of this preference can reveal under explored sites of resistance to alternative transport modes. This paper contributes to these understandings by examining the role the car as a time saving device plays in sustaining automobility. Its central proposition is that individual decisions to drive are not necessarily motivated by the desire to save time. The paper draws on empirical evidence on the journey to work in Australia's largest city, Sydney. Using a systematic process of trip substitution analysis, a group of people were identified who could use alternative transport to get to work in the same amount of time it currently takes them to drive. These people then participated in a series of in-depth interviews where deeper attachments and motivations for private car use were explored. This approach has enabled development of the multi-layered understanding that informs the central proposition that individual decisions to drive are not necessarily motivated by the desire to save time. Instead, automobility is sustained by appeals to flexibility and autonomy, as well as the interminable pull of the sensory experience provided by the cocoon of the car. This way of thinking about resistance to alternative transport exposes a series of inconsistencies between the expectations of those planning for, and those anticipated to one day use, alternative transport.},

However, these topics have not often been integrated in research or practice. This paper introduces a method to assess the extent to which reductions in ``Bicycle Level of Traffic Stress'' (LTS) on segments of a citywide bicycle network increase accessibility to supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, and public libraries. Six accessibility performance measures are developed and evaluated for 278 neighborhoods in Baltimore, Maryland using a GIS-based approach. The demographic distributions of accessibility results are further analyzed, focusing on disadvantaged populations. Using a set of 106 proposed bicycle projects, the marginal accessibility gains and cumulative demographic impact across affected neighborhoods are assessed for each project. These results are ranked and crosslisted to identify a set of projects that balance accessibility gains with equity objectives. The prioritization results demonstrate some overlap with the short-term priorities embodied in City of Baltimore's 2015 Bike Master Plan, but they also highlight projects in other areas, specifically those that would serve neighborhoods most disadvantaged in terms of racial segregation, high poverty rates, and low rates of vehicle ownership.},

Few studies have examined neighborhood perceptions related to walking and cycling for transport in different countries. Therefore, it is challenging to prioritize appropriate built-environment interventions.ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to examine the strength and shape of the relationship between adults' neighborhood perceptions and walking and cycling for transport across diverse environments.MethodsAs part of the International Physical activity and Environment Network (IPEN) adult project, self-reported data were taken from 13,745 adults (18\textendash 65 years) living in physically and socially diverse neighborhoods in 17 cities across 12 countries. Neighborhood perceptions were measured using the Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale, and walking and cycling for transport were measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire\textendash Long Form. Generalized additive mixed models were used to model walking or cycling for transport during the last seven days with neighborhood perceptions. Interactions by city were explored.ResultsWalking-for-transport outcomes were significantly associated with perceived residential density, land use mix\textendash access, street connectivity, aesthetics, and safety. Any cycling for transport was significantly related to perceived land use mix\textendash access, street connectivity, infrastructure, aesthetics, safety, and perceived distance to destinations. Between-city differences existed for some attributes in relation to walking or cycling for transport.ConclusionsMany perceived environmental attributes supported both cycling and walking; however, highly walkable environments may not support cycling for transport. People appear to walk for transport despite safety concerns. These findings can guide the implementation of global health strategies.CitationKerr J, Emond JA, Badland H, Reis R, Sarmiento O, Carlson J, Sallis JF, Cerin E, Cain K, Conway T, Schofield G, Macfarlane DJ, Christiansen LB, Van Dyck D, Davey R, Aguinaga-Ontoso I, Salvo D, Sugiyama T, Owen N, Mit\'a\v{s} J, Natarajan L. 2016.

  abstract = {This paper assesses the contemporary `consumption' of the motor-car in the context of an increased uptake of electric vehicles (EVs) as part of a transition to a low carbon automobility. Through the lens of affect and non-representational theory, it contributes to a seemingly neglected discourse by understanding how the feelings, experiences and knowledges of drivers 'conditioned' to an internal combustion engine (ICE) ecosystem might impact such a transition. This contribution is important, given that the contemporary socio-cultural significance of the car means an effective impetus for social change will come from drivers themselves. In-depth interviews explored unlived knowledges and opinions on EVs held by motorists driving ICE vehicles, comparing these with the lived experiences of EV drivers. Key findings point to levers and potential barriers. First, EV exposure suggests prospective electric propulsion carries no further fears than those experienced on any first `encounter' with a vehicle, indicating that although different, it is not viewed as a leap into the unknown. Second, ICE-drivers don't regard electric cars as inferior, providing they embody an ICE car's essence of freedom, flexibility and performance. Third, EV-drivers' sensations of avant garde and environmental-friendliness lack the physical nature of feelings expressed by ICE-drivers, yet suggest a new automobility. Addressing this `affectual' divide in how manufacturers design and disseminate knowledge about EVs is crucial to broadening their appeal. More broadly, whilst technical barriers to transition endure for consumers, the feelings and experiences concomitant with existing automobilities suggest cause for optimism regarding a potential low carbon vehicle uptake.},

The numerical technique and the error analysis are presented. This technique will allow researchers to video record traffic scenes and analyze them to estimate various microscopic and macroscopic traffic flow measures. These measures may be used to develop and validate traffic flow models. Very few studies have been conducted to study bicycle flow characteristics. The data collection technique presented here should allow researchers to collect bicycle flow data at very low cost.},

  abstract = {Participatory sensing is a powerful paradigm in which users participate in the sensing campaign by collecting and crowdsourcing fine-grained information and opinions about events of interest (such as weather or environment monitoring, traffic conditions or accidents, crime scenes, emergency response, healthcare and wellness management), thus leading to actionable inferences and decisions. Based on the nature of user involvement, participatory sensing applications can be of two types-automated and user manipulated. The first type of applications automatically collects data samples from smartphone sensors and sends them to the server. On the other hand, the second type of applications depends on the users to manually collect data samples and upload them at their convenience. Because of the high density of smartphone users in urban population and ease of participation, the automated participatory sensing paradigm can be effectively applied to continuous monitoring of various phenomena in urban scenarios (e.g., fine-grained temperature monitoring, noise or air pollution), leading to what is called participatory urban sensing. However, for creating a fine-grained and real-time map of the monitored area, the data samples need to be collected continuously (at a high frequency) which poses several research challenges. First, how to ensure coverage of the collected data that reflects how well the targeted area is monitored? Second, how to localize the smartphones since continuous usage of the location sensor (e.g., GPS) can drain the battery in few hours? Third, how to provide energy efficiency in the data collection process by collecting necessary data samples in each data collection round? In this article, we propose a novel framework called PLUS to address three major issues in real-time participatory urban monitoring applications, namely, ensuring coverage of the collected data, localization of the participating smartphones, and overall energy efficiency of the data collection process. Specifically the PLUS framework can guarantee a specified requirement of partial data coverage of the monitored area in an energy efficient manner. Additionally we devised a Markov-Predictor based energy efficient outdoor localization scheme for the mobile devices to participate in the data collection process. Simulation studies and real life experiments exhibit that PLUS can significantly reduce energy consumption of the mobile devices for urban monitoring applications as compared to traditional approaches.

The amounts of \&\#8220;proven\&\#8221; and potential fossil fuel reserves are uncertain and debated. Regardless of the true values, society has flexibility in the degree to which it chooses to exploit these reserves, especially unconventional fossil fuels and those located in extreme or pristine environments. If conventional oil production peaks within the next few decades, it may have a large effect on future atmospheric CO2 and climate change, depending upon subsequent energy choices. Assuming that proven oil and gas reserves do not greatly exceed estimates of the Energy Information Administration, and recent trends are toward lower estimates, we show that it is feasible to keep atmospheric CO2 from exceeding about 450 ppm by 2100, provided that emissions from coal, unconventional fossil fuels, and land use are constrained. Coal-fired power plants without sequestration must be phased out before midcentury to achieve this CO2 limit. It is also important to \&\#8220;stretch\&\#8221; conventional oil reserves via energy conservation and efficiency, thus averting strong pressures to extract liquid fuels from coal or unconventional fossil fuels while clean technologies are being developed for the era \&\#8220;beyond fossil fuels\&\#8221;.

Air pollution has been known as a major health hazard for decades. While its effects on cardiopulmonary morbidity and mortality have been extensively studied, growing evidence has emerged that exposure to polluted air is associated with impaired cognitive functions at all ages and increased risk of AD and other dementias in later life; this association is particularly notable with traffic related pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide, nitrous oxide, black carbon, and small diameter airborne solids and liquids known as particulate matter. The exact mechanisms by which air pollutants mediate neurotoxicity in the central nervous system (CNS) and lead to cognitive decline and AD remain largely unknown. Studies using animal and cell culture models indicate that amyloid-beta processing, anti-oxidant defense, and inflammation are altered following the exposure to constituents of polluted air. In this review, we summarize recent evidence supporting exposure to air pollution as a risk for cognitive decline at all ages and AD at later lifetime. Additionally, we review the current body of work investigating the molecular mechanisms by which air pollutants mediate damage in the CNS. Understanding of the neurotoxic effects of air pollution and its constituents is still limited, and further studies will be essential to better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms linking air pollution and cognitive decline.},

  abstract = {Currently dozens of U.S. cities are in the midst of planning and building modern streetcar systems. Though seemingly mobility investments, the intended impacts of these streetcar projects reach beyond transportation and represent a strong turn toward strategic spatial planning through transportation infrastructure. Proponents of modern streetcars argue that they are tools of placemaking as much as if not more than improvements for transit services. Unlike transit investments of a century ago, when privately operated streetcars were a decentralizing force that helped disperse overcrowded central city cores and open new land for real estate development, current streetcar projects in the United States are expected to concentrate activity and economic development in select corridors. The majority of these new systems rely on transit technologies that are significantly improved over the carriages of old, with modern features, smooth rides and quiet operations. Yet for all the improvements to the vehicles and services, new streetcar investments no longer primarily improve transit accessibility. Rather, modern streetcars are part of strategic amenity packages cities use to achieve real estate and economic development goals. This use of transportation infrastructure as an amenity for a particular location is a shift away from traditional transportation planning processes, and the expected benefits, in particular, stand apart as being deliberately spatial. We use planning documents and data from ballot box initiatives to evaluate expected transportation benefits relative to indirect benefits through economic development. We find that approximately three-quarters of all expected benefits from streetcar projects accrue to property development with the remaining expected benefits assigned to transportation. However, we do not find sufficient empirical evidence in the literature to support such certain claims of positive effects on property values and the built environment. We argue that the increasing tendency of cities to leverage streetcar projects for non-transportation purposes represents a turn to the use of infrastructure as a tool of spatial planning.},

  abstract = {Reducing working hours in an economy has been discussed as a policy which may have benefits in achieving particular economic, social and environmental goals. This study proposes five different scenarios to reduce the working hours of full-time employees by 20\% with the aim of cutting greenhouse gas emissions: a three-day weekend, a free Wednesday, reduced daily hours, increased holiday entitlement and a scenario in which the time reduction is efficiently managed by companies to minimise their office space. We conceptually analyse the effects of each scenario on time use patterns through both business and worker activities, and how these might affect energy consumption in the economy. To assess which of the scenarios may be most effective in reducing carbon emissions, this analytical framework is applied as a case study for the United Kingdom. The results suggest that three of the five scenarios offer similar benefits, and are preferable to the other two, with a difference between the best and worst scenarios of 13.03 MTCO2e. The study concludes that there is a clear preference for switching to a four-day working week over other possible work-reduction policies.},

  year = {2011},
  abstract = {This research, which was conducted from July 2008 to January 2010, investigated what type of cycling infrastructure would encourage `new cyclists' (ie people who either do not currently cycle at all, or people who do not currently cycle for utilitarian trips) to use cycling as their mode of transport for daily activities in New Zealand. The research involved undertaking an international literature review followed by national surveys and Christchurch-based focus groups, to gain an understanding of some of the motivations and barriers associated with utilitarian cycling, and to evaluate a range of cycling facilities. The research showed that safety was the most significant issue for potential cyclists, particularly in relation to vehicle driver behaviour and traffic volume. Other significant issues included having facilities at the destination for showering and changing, enjoyment, and the perception that car drivers are not courteous. The solutions that were most likely to effect a significant change in cycle numbers related to the nature and consistency of infrastructure, and education for motor vehicle drivers and cyclists on how to best and safely use it. The researchers recommended that along with a number of other cycling-supportive steps, planners could develop a comprehensive, consistent network of cycle-only paths with separation from motor vehicles, and with dedicated intersection facilities such as hook turns and cycle signals.},

The paper considers traditional methods of public participation and argues that new Internet-based technologies have the potential to widen participation in the UK planning system. Evidence is provided of the potential and actual benefits of online spatial decision support systems in the UK through a real environmental decision support problem in a village in northern England. The paper identifies key themes developing in this area of Web-based geographical information systems (GIS) and provides a case-study example of an online public participation GIS from inception to the final phase in a public participation process. It is shown that in certain UK planning problems and policy formulation processes, participatory online systems are a useful means of informing and engaging the public and can potentially bring the public closer to a participatory planning system.},

  abstract = {The nature of transportation has fundamentally transformed in recent years with the rise of ridehailing providers such as Uber. Yet, few studies have examined whether there is an association between ridehailing and rates of road accident injuries, and virtually all of the existing studies focus on the exceptional case of the United States. In this study, we exploit differences in the timing of the deployment of Uber across Britain to test the association between the advent of Uber's ridehailing services and rates of fatal and non-fatal road accidents. We find that the deployment of Uber in Great Britain is associated with a marginally significant reduction in the number of serious road accident injuries (e.g., fractures and internal injuries), although not the number of serious accidents. Slight injuries (e.g., sprains and bruises) declined outside of London after the rollout of Uber, but increased within London. We do not observe a statistically significant association between Uber and traffic fatalities. One interpretation for the decline in serious road injuries is that Uber may be a substitute form of transportation for risky drivers, including drink-drivers. However, ridehailing is also a substitute for public transit, particularly buses. The increase in the number of cars on the road may explain why slight injuries increased in London following Uber's rollout.},

It is relatively new subfield of data mining which gained high popularity especially in geographic information sciences due to the pervasiveness of all kinds of location-based or environmental devices that record position, time or/and environmental properties of an object or set of objects in real-time. As a consequence, different types and large amounts of spatio-temporal data became available that introduce new challenges to data analysis and require novel approaches to knowledge discovery. In this chapter we concentrate on the spatio-temporal clustering in geographic space. First, we provide a classification of different types of spatio-temporal data. Then, we focus on one type of spatio-temporal clustering - trajectory clustering, provide an overview of the state-of-the-art approaches and methods of spatio-temporal clustering and finally present several scenarios in different application domains such as movement, cellular networks and environmental studies.},

  abstract = {This article examines how the availability of Big Data, coupled with new data analytics, challenges established epistemologies across the sciences, social sciences and humanities, and assesses the extent to which they are engendering paradigm shifts across multiple disciplines. In particular, it critically explores new forms of empiricism that declare `the end of theory', the creation of data-driven rather than knowledge-driven science, and the development of digital humanities and computational social sciences that propose radically different ways to make sense of culture, history, economy and society. It is argued that: (1) Big Data and new data analytics are disruptive innovations which are reconfiguring in many instances how research is conducted; and (2) there is an urgent need for wider critical reflection within the academy on the epistemological implications of the unfolding data revolution, a task that has barely begun to be tackled despite the rapid changes in research practices presently taking place. After critically reviewing emerging epistemological positions, it is contended that a potentially fruitful approach would be the development of a situated, reflexive and contextually nuanced epistemology.},

The book assumes that you've written code in another programming language but makes no assumptions about which one, meaning the material is accessible and useful to developers from a wide variety of programming backgrounds.  ~ Known by the Rust community as ``The Book,'' The Rust Programming Language includes concept chapters, where you'll learn about a particular aspect of Rust, and project chapters, where you'll apply what you've learned so far to build small programs.~  ~ The Book opens with a quick hands-on project to introduce the basics then explores key concepts in depth, such as ownership, the type system, error handling, and fearless concurrency. Next come detailed explanations of Rust-oriented perspectives on topics like pattern matching, iterators, and smart pointers, with concrete examples and exercises--taking you from theory to practice. ~ The Rust Programming Language will also show you how to:- Grasp important concepts unique to Rust, like ownership, borrowing, and  ~ lifetimes- Use Cargo, Rust's built-in package manager, to build and maintain your code,  ~ including downloading and building dependencies- Effectively use Rust's zero-cost abstractions and employ your own ~ You'll learn to develop reliable code that's speed and memory efficient, while avoiding the infamous and arcane programming pitfalls common at the systems level. When you need to dive down into lower-level control, this guide will show you how without taking on the customary risk of crashes or security holes and without requiring you to learn the fine points of a fickle toolchain. ~You'll also learn how to create command line programs, build single- and multithreaded web servers, and much more.  ~ The Rust Programming Language fully embraces Rust's potential to empower its users. This friendly and approachable guide will help you build not only your knowledge of Rust but also your ability to program with confidence in a wider variety of domains.},

The empirical analysis is based on a theoretical model, which assumes that the output good is produced by capital, labour and energy according to a nested production function framework where capital and energy are combined by a CES function at the intermediate stage. The output responses to energy price changes are derived, using estimates of the elasticity of substitution. While industry suffered more from the oil price shock of the late 1970s than from that of the early 1970s and the 2004-2008 upsurge, evidence suggests the reverse for transportation. Regarding the impact on income distribution, both sectors share the same pattern, whereby in the recent episode, rising energy costs were more than compensated by falling unit labour costs, while in the 1970s, cost structures had been strained by an expansive wage policy in addition to the oil price shocks. \textcopyright{} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

Changes in workplace car parking policies may be effective in shifting behaviour. We use a natural experimental design to assess whether changes in policy were associated with differences in commute mode. Methods\hspace{0.6em} We used cohort data from participants working in Cambridge (2009\textendash 2012). Commuters reported their trips and travel modes to work over the last week, workplace car parking policy and socioeconomic, environmental and health characteristics. Changes in policy were defined between phases (1608 transition periods; 884 participants). Using generalised estimating equations, we estimated associations between changes in parking policy and the proportion of trips that (i) were exclusively by motor vehicle, (ii) involved walking or cycling and (iii) involved public transport at follow-up. Results\hspace{0.6em} 25.1\% of trips were made by motor vehicle, 54.6\% involved walking or cycling and 11.7\% involved public transport. The introduction of free or paid workplace parking was associated with higher proportions of motor vehicle trips (11.4\%, 95\%\,CI (6.4 to 16.3)) and lower proportions involving walking or cycling (-13.3\%, 95\%\,CI (-20.2 to \textendash 6.4)) and public transport (-5.8\%, 95\%\,CI (-10.6 to \textendash 0.9)) compared with those with no workplace parking. Restrictive changes in policy were associated with shifts in the expected direction but these were not statistically significant. Conclusion\hspace{0.6em} Relaxation of parking policy was associated with higher proportions of trips made by motor vehicle. Further longitudinal and intervention research is required to assess generalisability of these findings .},

Such a goal has been a continually recurring theme during the ensuing years; for example, we read in 1970 of the ``first steps toward transforming the art of programming into a science'' [26]. Meanwhile we have actually succeeded in making our discipline a science, and in a remarkably simple way: merely by deciding to call it ``computer science.''},

The nature of relations in their structures, functions, and temporal domains is characterized by a duality of contexts, an interrelatedness of the individual and local with the social and global. Causes, influences, and effects are mutual - and this at different scales. This book presents approaches that deal with interactions within and between the social and spatial realm, focusing on human behavior, land use change, and energy and infrastructure issues from an agent-based perspective.

Interviews conducted in Stockholm and Copenhagen showed that the organisation of the departments affects the social relations between the planners and creates power relations that either foster or marginalise cycling within planning processes. In Copenhagen, an integrated planning organisation allows for more knowledge exchange between urban, transport, and bicycle planners and creates an environment of understanding for different professional views on planning. However, this is not the case in Stockholm where cycling is marginalised in planning and in the existing infrastructure. This study concludes that the integrated transport and urban planning organisation in Copenhagen promotes cycling more than the less integrated planning organisation in Stockholm. Furthermore, it is concluded that the different organisations have led to different power relations that shape the outcome of the planning processes.},

Understanding the potential behavioral determinants necessitates understanding influences from three fundamental areas: 1) physiologic and developmental factors, 2) environmental factors, and 3) psychological, social, and demographic factors. The literature to date has generally investigated potential predictors of physical activity in children and adolescents in each of these three general areas, although existing data rely largely on cross-sectional studies in which it is difficult to distinguish a determinant from a correlate. In all likelihood, aspects of each of these three areas interact in a multidimensional way to influence physical activity in youth.

Measurement and analysis are integral components of network research. As a result, statistical methods play a critical role in network analysis. This book is the first of its kind in network research. It can be used as a stand-alone resource in which multiple R packages are used to illustrate how to conduct a wide range of network analyses, from basic manipulation and visualization, to summary and characterization, to modeling of network data. The central package is igraph, which provides extensive capabilities for studying network graphs in R. This text builds on Eric D.

  abstract = {Numerous theoretical frameworks have been developed to explain the gap between the possession of environmental knowledge and environmental awareness, and displaying pro-environmental behavior. Although many hundreds of studies have been undertaken, no definitive explanation has yet been found. Our article describes a few of the most influential and commonly used analytical frameworks: early US linear progression models; altruism, empathy and prosocial behavior models; and finally, sociological models. All of the models we discuss (and many of the ones we do not such as economic models, psychological models that look at behavior in general, social marketing models and that have become known as deliberative and inclusionary processes or procedures (DIPS)) have some validity in certain circumstances. This indicates that the question of what shapes pro-environmental behavior is such a complex one that it cannot be visualized through one single framework or diagram. We then analyze the factors that have been found to have some influence, positive or negative, on pro-environmental behavior such as demographic factors, external factors (e.g. institutional, economic, social and cultural) and internal factors (e.g. motivation, pro-environmental knowledge, awareness, values, attitudes, emotion, locus of control, responsibilities and priorities). Although we point out that developing a model that tries to incorporate all factors might neither be feasible nor useful, we feel that it can help illuminate this complex field. Accordingly, we propose our own model based on the work of Fliegenschnee and Schelakovsky (1998) who were influenced by Fietkau and Kessel (1981).},

  abstract = {The anticipated introduction of new forms of intelligent transport systems (ITS) represents a significant opportunity for increased cooperative mobility and sociotechnical changes within the transport system. Although such technologies are currently technically feasible, various socioeconomic and environmental barriers impede their arrival. This paper uses a recently developed ITS performance assessment framework, i.e., Environmental Fusion (EnvFUSION), to perform dynamic forecasting of the performance for three key ITS technologies: active traffic management (ATM), intelligent speed adaptation (ISA), and an automated highway system (AHS) using a mathematical theory of evidence. A consequential lifecycle assessment (c-LCA) is undertaken, which forms part of a data fusion process using data from various sources. The models forecast improvements for the three ITS technologies in line with social acceptability, economic profitability, and major carbon reduction scenarios up to 2050 on one of the U.K.'s most congested highways. An analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and the Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) are used to weight criteria that form part of an intelligent transport sustainability index (ITSI). Overall performance is then synthesized. Results indicate that there will be a substantial increase in socioeconomic and emissions benefits, provided that the policies are in place and targets are reached, which would otherwise delay their realization.},

  abstract = {This text is intended for a broad audience as both an introduction to predictive models as well as a guide to applying them. Non-mathematical readers will appreciate the intuitive explanations of the techniques while an emphasis on problem-solving with real data across a wide variety of applications will aid practitioners who wish to extend their expertise. Readers should have knowledge of basic statistical ideas, such as correlation and linear regression analysis. While the text is biased against complex equations, a mathematical background is needed for advanced topics.Dr. Kuhn is a Director of Non-Clinical Statistics at Pfizer Global R\&D in Groton Connecticut. He has been applying predictive models in the pharmaceutical and diagnostic industries for over 15 years and is the author of a number of R packages.~Dr. Johnson has more than a decade of statistical consulting and predictive modeling experience in pharmaceutical research and development.~ He is a co-founder of Arbor Analytics, a firm specializing in predictive modeling and is a former Director of Statistics at Pfizer Global R\&D.~ His scholarly work centers on the application and development of statistical methodology and learning algorithms.Applied Predictive Modeling covers the overall predictive modeling process, beginning with the crucial steps of data preprocessing, data splitting and foundations of model tuning.~ The text then provides intuitive explanations of numerous common and modern regression and classification techniques, always with an emphasis on illustrating and solving real data problems.~ Addressing practical concerns extends beyond model fitting to topics such as handling class imbalance, selecting predictors, and pinpointing causes of poor model performance\rule{1em}{1pt}all of which are problems that occur frequently in practice.~The text illustrates all parts of the modeling process through many hands-on, real-life examples.~ And every chapter contains extensive R code for each step of the process.~ The data sets and corresponding code are available in the book's companion AppliedPredictiveModeling R package, which is freely available on the CRAN archive.~This multi-purpose text can be used as an introduction to predictive models and the overall modeling process, a practitioner's reference handbook, or as a text for advanced undergraduate or graduate level predictive modeling courses.~ To that end, each chapter contains problem sets to help solidify the covered concepts and uses data available in the book's R package.~Readers and students interested in implementing the methods should have some basic knowledge of R.~ And a handful of the more advanced topics require some mathematical knowledge.},

  abstract = {There's a "Frank \& Ernest" comic strip showing a chick breaking out of its shell, looking around, and saying, "Oh, wow! Paradigm shift!" Blame the late Thomas Kuhn. Few indeed are the philosophers or historians influential enough to make it into the funny papers, but Kuhn is one. The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is indeed a paradigmatic work in the history of science. Kuhn's use of terms such as "paradigm shift" and "normal science," his ideas of how scientists move from disdain through doubt to acceptance of a new theory, his stress on social and psychological factors in science-all have had profound effects on historians, scientists, philosophers, critics, writers, business gurus, and even the cartoonist in the street. Some scientists (such as Steven Weinberg and Ernst Mayr) are profoundly irritated by Kuhn, especially by the doubts he casts-or the way his work has been used to cast doubt-on the idea of scientific progress. Yet it has been said that the acceptance of plate tectonics in the 1960s, for instance, was sped by geologists' reluctance to be on the downside of a paradigm shift. Even Weinberg has said that "Structure has had a wider influence than any other book on the history of science." As one of Kuhn's obituaries noted, "We all live in a post-Kuhnian age." -Mary Ellen Curtin},

To lower the barrier for using GTFS data in research, we publish a curated collection of 25 cities' public transport networks in multiple easy-to-use formats including network edge lists, temporal network event lists, SQLite databases, GeoJSON files, and the GTFS data format.

The method is intended to enhance understanding of travellers' behaviour during monitoring the smart card data. In order to supplement absent behavioural attributes in the smart card data, this study developed a data fusion methodology of smart card data with the person trip survey data with the na\"ive Bayes probabilistic model. A model for estimating the trip purpose is derived from the person trip survey data. By using the model, trip purposes are estimated as supplementary behavioural attributes of the trips observed in the smart card data. The validation analysis showed that the proposed method successfully estimated the trip purposes in 86.2\% of the validation data. The empirical data mining analysis showed that the proposed methodology can be applied to find and interpret the behavioural features observed in the smart card data which had been difficult to obtain from each independent dataset.},

  abstract = {Drawing on examples from human mobility research, I argue in this article that the advent of big data has significantly increased the role of algorithms in mediating the geographic knowledge production process. This increased centrality of algorithmic mediation introduces much more uncertainty to the geographic knowledge generated when compared to traditional modes of geographic inquiry. This article reflects on important changes in the geographic knowledge production process associated with the shift from using traditional ``small data'' to using big data and explores how computerized algorithms could considerably influence research results. I call into question the much touted notion of data-driven geography, which ignores the potentially significant influence of algorithms on research results, and the fact that knowledge about the world generated with big data might be more an artifact of the algorithms used than the data itself. As the production of geographic knowledge is now far more dependent on computerized algorithms than before, this article asserts that it is more appropriate to refer to this new kind of geographic inquiry as algorithm-driven geographies (or algorithmic geographies) rather than data-driven geography. The notion of algorithmic geographies also foregrounds the need to pay attention to the effects of algorithms on the content, reliability, and social implications of the geographic knowledge these algorithms help generate. The article highlights the need for geographers to remain attentive to the omissions, exclusions, and marginalizing power of big data. It stresses the importance of practicing critical reflexivity with respect to both the knowledge production process and the data and algorithms used in the process.},

Although planning professionals have reached a rather consistent consensus on the structural characteristics of sustainable urban form, i.e. urban consolidation or densification policy, these goals are often not shared by inhabitants. The resistance by local residents towards densification is based on the fear of losing the environmental qualities that they appreciate without getting added value. We argue that a planning strategy that is sensitive to the local context and respects the inhabitants' place experiences can help in finding unique solutions and in restraining conflicts. To realize the context sensitive strategy, new kind of location-based information from residents is needed: experiential knowledge that is tightly anchored to specific places. In this study, 3119 respondents from the Helsinki metropolitan area participated in a Web-based survey that helped define the quality factors meaningful to inhabitants. The softGIS method used is an example of public participation GIS that allows the study of inhabitants' location-based experiences. The over 10,000 place experiences gathered were analysed in relation to the home locations of respondents and to the number of urban structural characteristics, including urban density, green structure proportion, and land-use patterns. The findings revealed that although green structure was experientially very valuable, densely built areas were also meaningful for inhabitants, especially in regard to social quality. We conclude that the `soft', experiential information can be a welcome addition to the other layers of information in evidence-based planning.},

The full text of OA journals and articles can be freely read, as the publishing is funded through means other than subscriptions. Empirical research concerning the quantitative development of OA publishing has so far consisted of scattered individual studies providing brief snapshots, using varying methods and data sources. This study adopts a systematic method for studying the development of OA journals from their beginnings in the early 1990s until 2009. Because no comprehensive index of OA articles exists, systematic manual data collection from journal web sites was conducted based on journal-level data extracted from the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). Due to the high number of journals registered in the DOAJ, almost 5000 at the time of the study, stratified random sampling was used. A separate sample of verified early pioneer OA journals was also studied. The results show a very rapid growth of OA publishing during the period 1993-2009. During the last year an estimated 191 000 articles were published in 4769 journals. Since the year 2000, the average annual growth rate has been 18\% for the number of journals and 30\% for the number of articles. This can be contrasted to the reported 3,5\% yearly volume increase in journal publishing in general. In 2009 the share of articles in OA journals, of all peer reviewed journal articles, reached 7,7\%. Overall, the results document a rapid growth in OA journal publishing over the last fifteen years. Based on the sampling results and qualitative data a division into three distinct periods is suggested: The Pioneering years (1993-1999), the Innovation years (2000-2004), and the Consolidation years (2005-2009).},

Use of the term `big data' implies an approach that includes capacity to aggregate, search, cross-reference, and mine large volumes of data to generate new understanding that can inform decision-making about emergent properties of complex systems. Although big-data approaches are not a panacea, there are large-scale environmental questions for which big data are well suited, even necessary. Ecosystems are complex biophysical systems that are not easily defined by any one data type, location, or time. Understanding complex ecosystem properties is data intensive along axes of volume (size of data), velocity (frequency of data), and variety (diversity of data types). Ecosystem scientists have employed impressive technology for generating high-frequency, large-volume data streams. Yet important challenges remain in both theoretical and infrastructural development to support visualization and analysis of large and diverse data. The way forward includes greater support for network science approaches, and for development of big-data infrastructure that includes capacity for visualization and analysis of integrated data products. Likewise, a new paradigm of cross-disciplinary training and professional evaluation is needed to increase the human capital to fully exploit big-data analytics in a way that is sustainable and adaptable to emerging disciplinary needs.},

We analyzed the frequencies of R packages reported in more than 60,000 peer-reviewed articles published in 30 ecology journals during a 10-yr period ending in 2017. The number of studies reported using R as their primary tool in data analysis increased linearly from 11.4\% in 2008 to 58.0\% in 2017. The top 10 packages reported were lme4, vegan, nlme, ape, MuMIn, MASS, mgcv, ade4, multcomp, and car. The increasing popularity of R has most likely furthered open science in ecological research because it can improve reproducibility of analyses and captures workflows when scripts and codes are included and shared. These findings may not be entirely unique to R because there are other programming languages used by ecologists, but they do strongly suggest that given the relatively high frequency of reported use of R, it is a significant component of contemporary analytics in the field of ecology.},

Lakoff also breaks down the ways conservatives have framed the issues, and provides examples of how progressives can reframe the debate.Lakoff's years of research and work with environmental and political leaders have been distilled into this essential guide, which shows progressives how to think in terms of values instead of programs, and why people vote their values and identities, often against their best interests.},

  abstract = {London's internationally acclaimed " cycling revolution " was characterised by an unprecedented investment in cycling infrastructure, particularly cycle lanes manifesting as Cycle Superhighways or Quietways. Despite the hegemony of cycle lanes in London's overarching cycling paradigm, the London Borough of Hackney has historically achieved the city's highest rates of cycling and a long-standing reputation as a cycling borough in the absence of cycle lanes. Instead, Hackney has always opted for spatial interventions (such as filtered permeability, a borough-wide 20 mph speed restriction, and speed humps). This paper challenges Hackney's reputation as a cycling borough and the alleged success of its spatial interventions. I argue that Hackney's privileging of spatial fixes treats spatial interventions as apolitical and value-neutral, which ignores inequities entrenched in cycling. I also argue that Hackney has taken for granted its high rates of cycling, therefore effectively adopting a cycle-blind (akin to race-blind) and cycle mainstreaming (akin to gender mainstreaming) approach to cycling policy and interventions. Consequently, Hackney's spatial interventions for cycling raise the profile of already-visible privileged cyclists (white, middle-class men \textendash{} the middle-aged men in Lycra, or MAMILs, and the hipsters) for whom cycling is a lifestyle choice while further erasing " invisible cyclists " for whom cycling is an economic necessity. In order to be a relevant and sustainable mode of transportation for Hackney residents, equity and social justice must foreground the borough's approach to cycling.},

In the last 15 years, however, some cities discovered the advantages of increasing the cycling share for both life quality and a more sustainable transport system in their cities. This paper focuses on four case studies from the German cities of Munich, Hamburg, Berlin and Frankfurt, and investigates both the development of cycling policies and the changing use of the bicycle as mode of daily transport between 2002 and 2008 in these cities. By analysing policy documents, web sources and national travel data, we show (1) that the often claimed increase of cycling usage in Munich, Frankfurt and Berlin is supported, and (2) identify the implementation and strengthening of policies to promote cycling by the local government as crucial for these successes. These findings are supported by our fourth case study, Hamburg, where we were not able to identify an increased bicycle usage in this time period, where cycling promoting policies were adapted by the local government only in 2008 and, thus, effects can only be expected after 2008. Our findings support that, although local cycling policies are not the only factor for successfully increasing cycling usage, they play a crucial role in the process of increasing cycling use in cities. Both, cycling infrastructure improvements and communication campaigns, initiated, supported and executed by the local government, are key factors for increasing bicycle use in cities.},

While both studies of transportation and recreational cycling were eligible, the majority of the 12 included studies focused on the trip to/from school and consistently indicated that shorter distance between home and school is associated with greater odds of cycling. However, little is known about the correlates of cycling for other purposes. Furthermore, other built environment features have not been studied enough to allow strong conclusions to be drawn.

This paper focuses on how far people are willing to walk or cycle for different trip purposes in Montr\'eal, Canada and how travel distances vary spatially and by individuals' travel purpose and socioeconomic characteristics. This research uses the 2003 Montr\'eal Origin-Destination Survey (O-D Survey) to calculate the network distance traveled by pedestrians and cyclists and to obtain travel and socioeconomic characteristics for each individual. Whereas much walking distance literature focuses on distance to transit, this paper is focused on walking and cycling trips where a second transit mode is not the intended destination. Primarily, the paper reveals that median walking distances recorded in the O-D survey (650 meters) are greater than the commonly-accepted distance or catchment area of 400 meters, and that there are a variety of personal built environment factors that influence these distances. While no widely-held standard exists for cycling, the analysis reveals a median distance of around two kilometers with a high degree of variation in distances. These findings will guide planners, designers, developers, and policy makers when promoting for greater levels of walking and cycling and suggests future research directions within this field.},

  abstract = {Background Increasing active travel (walking, cycling, public transport) is increasingly seen as integral to strategies to raise physical activity levels. Purpose This study examined (1) sociodemographic correlates of active travel to work and (2) associations between active travel and cardiovascular risk factors in the United Kingdom (UK). Methods Data come from Understanding Society, a nationally representative survey of UK residents in 2009/2011, analyzed in 2012. Multinomial logistic regression assessed associations between sociodemographic factors and mode of transport to work. Linear and logistic regression was used to examine associations between mode of travel and overweight/obesity, and having hypertension or diabetes. Results A total of 69\% of participants traveled to work using private transport, with public transport, walking, and cycling used by 16\%, 12\%, and 3\%, respectively. Use of any active travel was more likely in participants living in London. Black participants were more likely to walk (AOR=1.41, 95\% CI=1.08, 1.84) or take public transport (AOR=2.34, 95\% CI=1.88, 2.90) to work than whites. Using public transport, walking, or cycling to work was associated with a lower likelihood of being overweight (AOR=0.80, 95\% CI=0.54, 0.88 for walking). Walking or cycling was associated with a lower likelihood of having diabetes, and walking was associated with a lower likelihood of having hypertension than private transport (AOR=0.83, 95\% CI=0.71, 0.97). Conclusions There are wide variations in the mode of travel to work across regions and sociodemographic groups in the UK. The protective association between active travel and cardiovascular risk demonstrated in this nationally representative study adds to growing evidence that concerted policy focus in this area may benefit population health. ?? 2013 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

The three primary goals of the project are: 1) Address the American diabetes and obesity epidemics by making exercising on a daily basis a more desirable and viable alternative. 2) Address the problem of greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants by partially replacing combustion engines with human-powered transportation. 3) Address the problem of the United States' dependence on foreign oil by diminishing energy demand for short-range transportation. The primary variables we will consider are N, the number of people being transported, d, the distance being traveled, C, the energy cost required to travel the distance, and t, the time required to travel the distance. The Bicycle Highway was found to have a poorer throughput rating when only construction costs were considered, but a better throughput rating when vehicle and fuel costs are introduced. The Bicycle Highway offers a timely and economical solution to the numerous side-effects of the century-long success of the gasoline-powered automobile. A transportation corridor that is designated solely for bicyclists, human-electric hybrid and zero-emission vehicles, would allow for a greater volume of commuter traffic with minimal energetic and entropic impact. This proposed roadway promises to make bicycle travel much safer and will alleviate frustration felt by motorists sharing the road with bicycles. We expect cost-effectiveness of our design to be enhanced further if reductions in obesity, asthma, and lung-disease related costs are considered in future case studies.},

While the data model is used by several cities, companies, and governments, in this paper we argue that its XML-based exchange format has several drawbacks. These drawbacks mean that it is difficult for developers to implement parsers for CityGML, and that practitioners have, as a consequence, to convert their data to other formats if they want to exchange them with others. We present CityJSON, a new JSON-based exchange format for the CityGML data model (version 2.0.0). CityJSON was designed with programmers in mind, so that software and APIs supporting it can be quickly built. It was also designed to be compact (a compression factor of around six with real-world datasets), and to be friendly for web and mobile development. We argue that it is considerably easier to use than the CityGML format, both for reading and for creating datasets. We discuss in this paper the main features of CityJSON, briefly present the different software packages to parse/view/edit/create files (including one to automatically convert between the JSON and GML encodings), analyse how real-world datasets compare to those of CityGML, and we also introduce Extensions, which allow us to extend the core data model in a documented manner.},

The conclusions can be summarized in three points: 1. In general, none of the goals held out for large-scale models have been achieved, and there is little reason to expect anything different in the future. 2. For each objective offered as a reason for building a model, there is either a better way of achieving the objective (more information at less cost) or a better objective (a more socially useful question to ask). 3. Methods for long-range planning-whether they are called comprehensive planning, large-scale systems simulation, or something else-need to change drastically if planners expect to have any influence on the long run.},

  abstract = {Background: Active transportation modes like walking and bicycling are increasingly being acknowledged for their individual and societal benefits. However, active transportation projects are often implemented without consideration for equity and their benefits are not equitably distributed. This paper aims to provide a practical synthesis to more effectively integrate equity into active transportation planning. Methods: We first conducted a multidisciplinary literature review to better understand equity and its role in transportation. Following these insights, we assessed the findings and limitations of recent active transportation equity research. We then examined selected pedestrian and bicycle master plans from major cities in the United States to understand how equity is currently being addressed in active transportation planning practice. Based on our findings, we proposed a working definition of active transportation equity and used this definition to develop a set of recommendations. Results: The active transportation equity literature was somewhat limited and primarily focused on pedestrian equity. There was a wide disparity in the extent to which cities in the United States are prioritizing equity, but for the most part equity was not a primary planning goal. One of the difficulties for agencies is a lack of quality data, therefore it would be beneficial for researchers to look into methods for improving active transportation equity measures, and whenever possible, non-motorized modes should be analyzed independently. When equity was considered by researchers or planners, it was typically from the perspective of access to active transportation facilities for low-income or minority populations. We suggest that the equity implications of other social groups should be considered, with a focus on public participation from underrepresented populations. Furthermore, equity analysis would benefit from the incorporation of other factors aside from facility accessibility, such as safety, cost, or the availability of attractive destinations. Conclusions: Although a growing area of research, active transportation equity is infrequently studied and often goes overlooked in the planning process. In practice, equity was often narrowly focused on describing facility accessibility for a small set of social or},

More than 3\% of all tweets are found to have native location information available, while a naive geocoder based on a simple major cities gazetteer and relying on the user-provided Location and Profile fields is able to geolocate more than a third of all tweets with high accuracy when measured against the GPS-based baseline. Geographic proximity is found to play a minimal role both in who users communicate with and what they communicate about, providing evidence that social media is shifting the communicative landscape.},

  abstract = {This research critically engages with existing theories of class and urban governance, and is empirically located in Delhi, India. The paper argues that existing theories of urban participatory governance in the global South, which polarise urban citizens and their mobilisation strategies into the elite, typically understood as guilty of capturing participatory structures; and the poor, conceptualised as excluded from formal governance mechanisms but active in more politicised forms of mobilisation, are incomplete. This research identifies urban citizens who fit neither the elite nor poor conceptual binary, and explores how such ordinary citizens engage in participatory urban governance. Empirically, research addresses Delhis unauthorised colonies (UCs), residential areas that have evolved mostly on private land that is not classified residential in the Delhi Master Plan. Housing roughly a quarter to one-third of Delhis population and comprising a mix of classes, UCs are technically illegal locations for residential development, are consequently excluded from Delhis network of basic urban services (water, roads, electricity) and face potential demolition. UCs are conceptualised as representing Indias missing middle both empirically, highlighting the multiplicity of the middle class, and conceptually, revealing the failure of binary concepts to accurately describe participatory urban governance for those in the middle. In addition, analysis highlights how UCs invisibility (linked to their heterogeneity i.e. their empirical and conceptual middle-ness) functions as both an asset and a limitation in terms of participation in urban governance. The paper calls for greater recognition in academic and policy debates regarding the nuances in everyday life that are overlooked by neat binaries. As the Delhi case shows, a large proportion of urban populations are neither poor nor elite, and arguably a similar trend is likely to exist in cities throughout the world where segments of populations demographically in the middle are missing from academic and policy debates.},

This is the approach adopted in the present study in reference to the theory of planned behaviour. More precisely, the aim of this study was to determine the contribution of cognitive and environmental variables in the prediction of active commuting to get to and from work or school. Methods: A prospective study was carried out with 130 undergraduate and graduate students (93 females; 37 males). Environmental, cognitive and socio-demographic variables were evaluated at baseline by questionnaire. Two weeks later, active commuting (walking/bicycling) to get to and from work or school was self-reported by questionnaire. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were performed to predict intention and behaviour. Results: The model predicting behaviour based on cognitive variables explained more variance than the model based on environmental variables (37.4\% versus 26.8\%; Z = 3.86, p {$<$} 0.001). Combining cognitive and environmental variables with socio-demographic variables to predict behaviour yielded a final model explaining 41.1\% (p {$<$} 0.001) of the variance. The significant determinants were intention, habit and age. Concerning intention, the same procedure yielded a final model explaining 78.2\% (p {$<$} 0.001) of the variance, with perceived behavioural control, attitude and habit being the significant determinants. Conclusion: The results showed that cognitive variables play a more important role than environmental variables in predicting and explaining active commuting. When environmental variables were significant, they were mediated by cognitive variables. Therefore, individual cognitions should remain one of the main focuses of interventions promoting active commuting among undergraduate and graduate students.},

The study consists of a cross-sectional study conducted from 2010 to 2011 with 1000 adults. PA was measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. In a subsample of 250 adults, PA was objectively measured using ActiGraph accelerometers. Analyses were conducted using multilevel logistic regression models. The use of TM was associated with meeting moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA). TM users were more likely to complete an average of {$>$}22 min a day of MVPA (odds ratio [OR] = 3.1, confidence interval [CI] = 95 \% 1.4\textendash 7.1) and to walk for transportation for {$\geq$}150 min per week (OR = 1.5; CI = 95 \% 1.1\textendash 2.0). The use of TM was associated with 12 or more minutes of MVPA (95 \% CI 4.5\textendash 19.4, p {$<$} 0.0001). Associations between meeting PA recommendations and use of TM did not differ by socioeconomic status (p value = 0.106) or sex (p value = 0.288). The use of TM is a promising strategy for enhancing public health efforts to reduce physical inactivity through walking for transport. Given the expansion of BRTs, these results could inform the development of transport PA programs in low- to high-income countries.},

Since we have to model small commuting flows between municipalities with a few hundreds or thousands inhabitants, we opt for a stochastic model presented by Gargiulo et al. 2012. It reproduces the various possible complete networks using an iterative process, stochastically choosing a workplace in the region for each commuter living in the municipality of a region. The choice is made considering the job offers in each municipality of the region and the distance to all the possible destinations. This paper presents how to adapt and implement this model to generate French regions commuting networks between municipalities. We address three different questions: How to generate a reliable virtual commuting network for a region highly dependant of other regions for the satisfaction of its resident's demand for employment? What about a convenient deterrence function? How to calibrate the model when detailed data is not available? We answer proposing an extended job search geographical base for commuters living in the municipalities, we compare two different deterrence functions and we show that the parameter is a constant for network linking French municipalities.},

Electricity therefore deserves particular attention with regard to its contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions, which is reflected in the ongoing development of low-carbon technologies for power generation. The focus of this updated review of electricity-generating technologies is twofold: (a) to provide more technical information than is usually found in global assessments on critical technical aspects, such as variability of wind power, and (b) to capture the most recent findings from the international literature. This report covers eight technologies. Seven of these are generating technologies: hydro-, nuclear, wind, photovoltaic, concentrating solar, geothermal and biomass power. The remaining technology is carbon capture and storage.

  abstract = {Network structure varies across cities. This variation may yield important knowledge about how the internal structure of the city affects its performance. This paper systematically compares a set of surface transportation network structure variables (connectivity, hierarchy, circuity, treeness, entropy, accessibility) across the 50 largest metropolitan areas in the United States. A set of scaling parameters are discovered to show how network size and structure vary with city size. These results suggest that larger cities are physically more inter-connected. Hypotheses are presented as to why this might obtain. This paper then consistently measures and ranks access to jobs across 50 US metropolitan areas. It uses that accessibility measure, along with network structure variables and city size to help explain journey-to-work time and auto mode share in those cities. A 1 percent increase in accessibility reduces average metropolitan commute times by about 90 seconds each way. A 1 percent increase in network connectivity reduces commute time by 0.1 percent. A 1 percent increase in accessibility results in a 0.0575 percent drop in auto mode share, while a 1 percent increase in treeness reduces auto mode share by 0.061 percent. Use of accessibility and network structure measures is important for planning and evaluating the performance of network investments and land use changes.},

  abstract = {Global energy consumption is projected to increase, even in the face of substantial declines in energy intensity, at least 2-fold by midcentury relative to the present because of population and economic growth. This demand could be met, in principle, from fossil energy resources, particularly coal. However, the cumulative nature of CO(2) emissions in the atmosphere demands that holding atmospheric CO(2) levels to even twice their preanthropogenic values by midcentury will require invention, development, and deployment of schemes for carbon-neutral energy production on a scale commensurate with, or larger than, the entire present-day energy supply from all sources combined. Among renewable energy resources, solar energy is by far the largest exploitable resource, providing more energy in 1 hour to the earth than all of the energy consumed by humans in an entire year. In view of the intermittency of insolation, if solar energy is to be a major primary energy source, it must be stored and dispatched on demand to the end user. An especially attractive approach is to store solar-converted energy in the form of chemical bonds, i.e., in a photosynthetic process at a year-round average efficiency significantly higher than current plants or algae, to reduce land-area requirements. Scientific challenges involved with this process include schemes to capture and convert solar energy and then store the energy in the form of chemical bonds, producing oxygen from water and a reduced fuel such as hydrogen, methane, methanol, or other hydrocarbon species.},

  abstract = {The Big Data revolution promises to transform how we live, work, and think by enabling process optimization, empowering insight discovery and improving decision making. The realization of this grand potential relies on the ability to extract value from such massive data through data analytics; machine learning is at its core because of its ability to learn from data and provide data driven insights, decisions, and predictions. However, traditional machine learning approaches were developed in a different era, and thus are based upon multiple assumptions, such as the data set fitting entirely into memory, what unfortunately no longer holds true in this new context. These broken assumptions, together with the Big Data characteristics, are creating obstacles for the traditional techniques. Consequently, this paper compiles, summarizes, and organizes machine learning challenges with Big Data. In contrast to other research that discusses challenges, this work highlights the cause-effect relationship by organizing challenges according to Big Data Vs or dimensions that instigated the issue: volume, velocity, variety, or veracity. Moreover, emerging machine learning approaches and techniques are discussed in terms of how they are capable of handling the various challenges with the ultimate objective of helping practitioners select appropriate solutions for their use cases. Finally, a matrix relating the challenges and approaches is presented. Through this process, this paper provides a perspective on the domain, identifies research gaps and opportunities, and provides a strong foundation and encouragement for further research in the field of machine learning with Big Data.},

A total number of 707 LCH docking stations are included for a period of 36 weeks. Covariates such as socio-demographic characteristics, traffic conditions, and the built environment are included in the data set. A difference in difference (DID) based propensity score matching (PSM) method is applied to select control docking stations and estimate the effects of the dockless bike-sharing systems on the LCH usage. The results suggest that a significant reduction of 22.42 (5.93\%) in the average weekly usage of each LCH docking station is caused by the dockless bike-sharing system after its initial launch. We also investigate the effects of dockless bike-sharing systems on the characteristics of the LCH trips, including travel duration, travel distance, and departure time. The majority of trips replaced by the dockless bikes are short duration (0\textendash 15 min) and middle distance (1\textendash 3 km) trips. The reduction in the average weekly short duration trips of each station is 16.91 (7.16\%), while the figure is 15.11 (6.74\%) for middle distance trips. The average travel duration is increased by 0.25 min, but the travel distance shows no significant change due to data restriction. Furthermore, the LCH usage is significantly reduced by 6.85\% during the weekday commuting peak, and 10.47\% during the weekend leisure peak. As to weekday off-peak and other times, reductions are not statistically significant.},

  abstract = {This paper evaluates the effects of the London Cycle Superhighways (CS) on cycle collisions. A total of 45 CS segments and 375 control segments are observed for a period of 8 years in London. Variables such as road characteristics, crash history and socio-economic information are included in the data set. Traffic characteristics including traffic volume, cycle volume and traffic speed are obtained from Department for Transport. We first estimate the safety effects on the CS routes using Empirical Bayes methods. Then propensity score matching methods are also applied for comparison. The introduction of cycle superhighways caused cycling traffic volumes to increase dramatically along CS routes with no significant impacts on collision rates. Our models find that the increase in traffic was associated with a rise in annual total cycle collisions of around 2.6 per km (38\% in percentage). However, when we re-estimate the effects based on cycle collision rates rather than levels, our results also show that the CS routes are not more dangerous or safer than the control roads. Among the four CS routes, CS3 performs the best in protecting cyclists with a large proportion of segregated lanes whilst the cyclists have to share the lanes with motorists on other routes. It is recommended that consistent safety designs should be applied on all CS routes for a safer cycling environment.},

  abstract = {Spatial inequality in transport access is both the driver and outcome of rising economic inequality in Southeast Asia. Unlike many regional disparity studies that focus on national economic indicators, this paper takes an urban network approach to assess the spatial inequality in Southeast Asian intercity transport network. We analyze urban connectivity in intercity road, rail, and air networks for a total of 47 Southeast Asian cities. Spatial inequality at the city and network level is revealed via centrality measures and community detection, respectively. Gini coefficients for individual centrality rankings point to a hierarchical degree distribution, a rather even distribution of closeness centrality, and a highly concentrated distribution of betweenness centrality. Four network communities are identified, reflecting the influences of entrenched uneven development, fragmented geography, and economic and political policies.},

  abstract = {The implementation of transport infrastructure plans often has significant impacts on landscapes, especially where new roads and railroads are built. Key decisions regarding the building of new transport infrastructures are often made on a strategic level, where the long-term development of a region is determined, and before the infrastructure project actually begins. In this paper we build on previous advances in Strategic Environmental Assessment theory by linking the process-related issues of the integration of these assessments in general to landscape issues in particular; we use a multiple case study of Swedish transport planning. Results of this study indicate that the particular planning processes we looked at failed to carry out strategic landscape assessments and integrate landscape assessments in the planning process. We conclude that this can be explained by the flawed procedure of assessing landscape, the unhelpful structuring of SEA reports and by process-related issues. The idea of applying a holistic understanding of landscape, in line with the ELC, was notably absent from the studied cases. The lack of consideration of landscape as a whole can be attributed to poor use of dissipated and fragmented knowledge about landscapes as well as weaknesses in the assessment procedure. Our results indicate that the traditions of EIA are still prevalent in the practice of SEA, despite the fact that SEA theory has moved away from EIA-based methodology to become a tool for integrating environmental concerns into decision-making and for paying close attention to strategic decision processes.},

Until recently, this was not always the case. Instead, transport research and geography evolved widely independently in domain silos. However, driven by recent conceptual, methodological and technical developments, the need for an integrated approach is obvious. This paper attempts to outline the potential of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) for transport modeling. We identify three fields of transport modeling where the spatial perspective can significantly contribute to a more efficient modeling process and more reliable model results, namely, geospatial data, disaggregated transport models and the role of geo-visualization. For these three fields, available findings from various domains are compiled, before open aspects are formulated as research directions, with exemplary research questions. The overall aim of this paper is to strengthen the spatial perspective in transport modeling and to call for a further integration of GIS in the domain of transport modeling.},

They aim to identify contributing risk factors and calculate risk rates based on \textendash{} most of the time \textendash{} highly aggregated statistical data. In contrast to such explanatory study designs, the presented study follows an exploratory approach, focusing on the absolute number of crashes. The aim is to reveal and describe patterns and dynamics of urban bicycle crashes on various spatial scale levels and temporal resolutions through a multi-stage workflow. Spatial units are delineated in the network space and serve as initial units of aggregation. In order to facilitate comparisons among regions and quantify temporal dynamics, a reference value of crash frequency is simulated for each unit of the respective spatial scale level and temporal resolution. For the presented case study, over 3000 geo-coded bicycle crashes in the city of Salzburg (Austria) were analyzed. The data set covers 10years and comprises all bicycle crashes reported by the police. Distinct spatial and temporal patterns with clusters, seasonal variations, and regional particularities could be revealed. These insights are indicators for urban dynamics in the transport system and allow for further, targeted in-depth analyses and subsequent counter measures. Moreover, the results prove the applicability of the proposed multi-stage workflow and demonstrate the added value of analyses of small aggregates on various scale levels, down to single crashes, and temporal resolutions.},

The catalyst to the emergence of geocomputation is the new and creative application of computers to devise and depict digital representations of the Earth's surface. The environment for geocomputation is provided by geographical information systems (GIS), yet geocomputation is much more than GIS. Geocomputation is a blend of research-led applications which emphasise process over form, dynamics over statics, and interaction over passive response. This book presents a timely blend of current research and practice, written by the leading figures in the field. It provides insights to a new and rapidly developing area, and identifies the key foundations to future developments. It should be read by all who seek to use geocomputational methods for solving real world problems.},

Policy needs to be based on evidence about people's views of walking and cycling as well as effects of interventions. METHODS: Studies of the views of children, young people and parents about walking and cycling were searched for systematically, and a framework analysis applied. The findings were synthesised and compared with the findings of an effectiveness review of interventions for encouraging walking and cycling as an alternative to motorised transport. RESULTS: The synthesis of views described a culture of car use, fed by a fear and dislike of local environments and parental responses that emphasised children's safety at the expense of developing their independence, despite children expressing responsible attitudes towards transport choices. Comparison with effectiveness literature found that most evaluated interventions targeted only the public's fear and dislike of local environments. CONCLUSION: Interventions need to address pedestrian and cyclist safety, perceptions of risk, and parental norms regarding children's independence.},

However, a fourth v\textemdash veracity (or lack thereof)\textemdash has been conspicuously lacking from the literature. This article sets out to test the potential for verifying large data sets. It does this by cross-comparing three unrelated estimates of retail flows\textemdash human movements from home locations to shopping centers\textemdash derived from the following geo-coded sources: (1) a major mobile telephone service provider; (2) a commercial consumer survey; and (3) geotagged Twitter messages. Three spatial interaction models also provided estimates of flow: constrained and unconstrained versions of the ``gravity model'' and the recently developed ``radiation model.'' We found positive relationships between all data-based and theoretical sources of estimated retail flows. Based on the analysis, the mobile telephone data fitted the modeled flows and consumer survey data closely, while flows obtained directly from the Twitter data diverged from other sources. The research highlights the importance of verification in flow data derived from new sources and demonstrates methods for achieving this.},

  abstract = {Background It is important to model the determinants of mode choice for many health-related reasons: to find-out what is holding people back from healthy active travel choices, to understand the drivers of detrimental car dependency, and to identify the causal factors over which public authorities have some control. Another motivation is that model results could feed into forecasts of behaviour change following specific interventions. Numerous papers have explored the issue but few have been able to provide results that can feed-into models forecasting uptake following local interventions for a number of reasons including small sample size, lack of a temporal component, and use of explanatory variables that cannot easily be applied beyond the case study region. This gap in the literature was identified and tackled as part of a UK Department for Transport funded project to develop a Cycling Infrastructure Prioritisation Toolkit (CyIPT). Methods Origin-destination (OD) data on commuter mode choice was obtained from the 2001 and 2011 Census. The data was processed to ensure that the 2001 data, which was provided at a different geographic level, as compatible with the 2011 data. It was further processed to create a dependent variable (cycling uptake) and explanatory variables including environmental (e.g. length of off-road cycle infrastructure) and demographic (e.g. age and gender splits) factors, for each desire-line. A model was developed to explain cycling uptake as a function of the explanatory variables and forecast future uptake following simulated interventions. Results Preliminary results show a clear infrastructure signal in the noise surrounding mode choice but other factors seem to be at play. Further research over the coming months will seek to improve the model and our resulting ability to forecast uptake at the local level from specific interventions. Conclusions Newly available data, combined with emerging high performance and open source statistical software, mean that large natural experiments on the impact of new infrastructure on mode choice can now be performed at the national level using geographically detailed data at the origin-destination level. This has the potential to make the prioritisation of new infrastructure much more evidence-based and holds the promise of allowing a-priori benefit-cost estimates to be automated to support transport planners to enable a rapid transition away from fossil fuels and towards healthy travel patterns across the world, in urban and rural areas alike.},

  abstract = {Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF), also known as biproportional fitting, `raking' or the RAS algorithm, is an established procedure used in a variety of applications across the social sciences. Primary amongst these for urban modelling has been its use in static spatial microsimulation to generate small area microdata \textemdash{} individual level data allocated to administrative zones. The technique is mature, widely used and relatively straight-forward. Although IPF is well described mathematically, accessible examples of the algorithm written in modern programming languages are rare. There is a tendency for researchers to `start from scratch', resulting in a variety of ad hoc implementations and little evidence about the relative merits of differing approaches. These knowledge gaps mean that answers to certain methodological questions must be guessed: How can `empty cells' be identified and how do they influence model fit? Can IPF be made more computationally efficient? This paper tackles these questions and more using a systematic methodology with publicly available code and data. The results demonstrate the sensitivity of the results to initial conditions, notably the presence of `empty cells', and the dramatic impact of software decisions on computational efficiency. The paper concludes by proposing an agenda for robust and transparent future tests in the field.},

  abstract = {Pro-cycling interventions, and cycle hire schemes in particular, are often assumed to primarily benefit the privileged. This framing has played-out in academic research, with many papers exploring the relationship between cycling and existing inequalities. A growing body of evidence suggests that cycle hire schemes tend to serve wealthy areas and young, high income groups, mirroring inequalities in other types of cycling uptake, yet there has been little research into the `direction of travel' and whether such inequalities are growing or `levelling up' over time. This paper explores the uptake of the London Cycle Hire Scheme (LCHS), a large, early and prominent scheme that had the explicit aim of `normalising' cycling. The method involved reproducible analysis (with code documented in the GitHub repo Robinlovelace/cycle-hire-inclusive) of 73.4 million cycle high records spanning 8~years from January 2012 to December 2019, using the geographic location of docking stations alongside official statistics to assess social and spatial inequalities in uptake. The method involved analysis of 73.4 million cycle high records spanning 8~years from January 2012 to December 2019, using the geographic location of docking stations alongside official statistics to assess social and spatial inequalities in uptake. We found that, contrary to the trend for increasing segregation and geographic inequalities, the usage of the LCHS have become increasingly geographically distributed across London over time, with AM peak usage in comparatively low-income areas seeing high levels of growth. Our study shows that cycle hire schemes can be designed and expanded in ways that benefit a wide range of people, including those from low income areas, and that new cycle hire docking stations in poorer areas can succeed.},

OD data is inherently spatial and is complex, due to the multitude of ways of allocating geographic attributes to the OD pairs (e.g. buffers and intersections with geographic representations of OD data generated using straight desire lines, shortest path algorithms or probabilistic routing). This makes their analysis an interesting geocomputational challenge, seldom tackled by geographers. The application of Machine Learning and DAG methods, developed in other fields, to this geographical data holds great potential to improve the ability to infer causality in mode split from OD data. However, there are also pitfalls to using these methods which can be black boxes, even if the code is open source, if the analyst does not understand what they are doing with the data. Based on the work we discuss ways to ensure new methods in the field are used wisely and set-out next steps for our own research.},

Transport models can play a major role in tackling these issues through the transport planning process, but they have historically been focussed on motorised modes (especially cars) and available only to professional transport planners working within the existing paradigm. Building on the principles of open access software, first developed in the context of geographic information systems, this paper develops and discusses the concept of open access transport models, which we define as models that are both developed using open source software and are available to be used by the public without the need for specialist training or the purchase of software licences. We explore the future potential of open access transport models to support the transition away from fossil fuels in the transport sector. We do this with reference to the literature on the use of tools in the planning process, and by exploring an example that is already in use: the `Propensity to Cycle Tool'. We conclude that open access transport models can be a leverage point in the planning process due to their ability to provide robust, transparent and actionable evidence that is available to a range of stakeholders, not just professional transport planners. Open access transport models represent a disruptive technology deserving further research and development, by planners, researchers and citizen scientists, including open source software developers and advocacy groups but, in order to fulfil their potential, they will require both financial and policy support from government bodies.},

  abstract = {Geographic analysis has long supported transport plans that are appropriate to local contexts. Many incumbent `tools of the trade' are proprietary and were developed to support growth in motor traffic, limiting their utility for transport planners who have been tasked with twenty-first century objectives such as enabling citizen participation, reducing pollution, and increasing levels of physical activity by getting more people walking and cycling. Geographic techniques\textemdash such as route analysis, network editing, localised impact assessment and interactive map visualisation\textemdash have great potential to support modern transport planning priorities. The aim of this paper is to explore emerging open source tools for geographic analysis in transport planning, with reference to the literature and a review of open source tools that are already being used. A key finding is that a growing number of options exist, challenging the current landscape of proprietary tools. These can be classified as command-line interface, graphical user interface or web-based user interface tools and by the framework in which they were implemented, with numerous tools released as R, Python and JavaScript packages, and QGIS plugins. The review found a diverse and rapidly evolving `ecosystem' tools, with 25 tools that were designed for geographic analysis to support transport planning outlined in terms of their popularity and functionality based on online documentation. They ranged in size from single-purpose tools such as the QGIS plugin AwaP to sophisticated stand-alone multi-modal traffic simulation software such as MATSim, SUMO and Veins. Building on their ability to re-use the most effective components from other open source projects, developers of open source transport planning tools can avoid `reinventing the wheel' and focus on innovation, the `gamified' A/B Street https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/\#abstreetsimulation software, based on OpenStreetMap, a case in point. The paper, the source code of which can be found at https://github.com/robinlovelace/open-gat, concludes that, although many of the tools reviewed are still evolving and further research is needed to understand their relative strengths and barriers to uptake, open source tools for geographic analysis in transport planning already hold great potential to help generate the strategic visions of change and evidence that is needed by transport planners in the twenty-first century.},

  abstract = {Methods for estimating cycling potential for single-mode trips are well-established. Less attention has been paid to the question of how to promote cycling as the first leg of multi-stage trips involving public transport (PT). This  `bike \& ride' option has many potential benefits: boosting the level of cycling beyond that attainable through promotion of single-mode cycle trips alone; reducing car dependency in suburban areas not generally viewed as having high cycling potential; and reviving demand for PT services. But how to plan for `bike \& ride' uptake? This paper presents a reproducible method for estimating bike \& ride potential, based on geographic analysis of catchment areas and stated preference surveys of the relevant population. We illustrate the method using a case study of Seville, with insights into suitable locations for new cycle paths and appropriately sized cycle parking facilities to encourage bike \& ride uptake. Deployed in other cities, we conclude that these methods could provide a strong evidence base for the cost-effective investment in new suburban cycling infrastructure.},

This creates the need for tools and methods to help answer the question `where to build?'. Following a brief review of the policy and research context related to this question, this paper describes the design, features and potential applications of such a tool. The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) is an online, interactive planning support system that was initially developed to explore and map cycling potential across England (see www.pct.bike). Based on origin-destination data it models cycling levels at area, desire line, route and route network levels, for current levels of cycling, and for scenario-based `cycling futures.' Four scenarios are presented, including `Go Dutch' and `Ebikes,' which explore what would happen if English people had the same propensity to cycle as Dutch people and the potential impact of electric cycles on cycling uptake. The cost effectiveness of investment depends not only on the number of additional trips cycled, but on wider impacts such as health and carbon benefits. The PCT reports these at area, desire line, and route level for each scenario. The PCT is open source, facilitating the creation of scenarios and deployment in new contexts. We conclude that the PCT illustrates the potential of online tools to inform transport decisions and raises the wider issue of how models should be used in transport planning.},

In this study, 8400 community residents aged 18 or above were interviewed following a multistage random sampling method (100\% response rate). Face-to-face questionnaire survey data, anthropometric measurements, and biochemical data from blood tests were collected. Results show that 49.6\% of the subjects, as part of daily transport, actively traveled on average 5.3 days per week, 53.5 minutes per day, and 300.3 minutes per week. There was an inverse correlation between AT and some health outcomes: AT respondents had a higher prevalence of cholesterol disorder; AT respondents who actively travelled every day had a higher risk of diabetes, whilst AT respondents with shorter daily or weekly duration had a lower risk of obesity, central obesity, and cholesterol disorder. Moreover, AT influences more health aspects among urban residents than among rural residents. Findings of this study do not support the notion that AT is beneficial to population health. Further research is needed in determining the negative side effects of AT.},

This conversion greatly empowers a spatial network study, as the vast array of graph analytical tools provided in igraph are then readily available to the network analysis, together with the inherent advantages of being within the R statistical computing environment and its vast array of statistical functions. Through three urban road network case studies, the calculation of road network distances with shp2graph and with igraph is demonstrated through four key stages: (i) confirming the connectivity of a spatial network; (ii) integrating points/locations with a network; (iii) converting a network into a graph; and (iv) calculating network distances (and travel times). Throughout, the required R commands are given to provide a useful tutorial on the use of shp2graph.},

  abstract = {Over the course of the past two decades, bicycling has become increasingly popular in the USA. Although the rate of bike trips made in the USA has more than tripled since 1977, it is relatively low compared with many European cities (Pucher et al., 2011a). In urban areas throughout the USA, bicycling is increasingly being touted as an environmentally friendly way to enhance transit choice as public transportation budgets are slashed and automobile infrastructures remain congested. Discourse around the proliferation of bicycling infrastructure development in American cities often obscures complex aspects of community-level choice regarding transit, including the placement and implementation of bike lanes. This paper seeks to explore the dynamic ways that community members and city planners make sense of bike infrastructure development in Chicago, Illinois. Qualitative interviews and participant observation were employed to clarify the community context of bike lane development in a gentrifying area of the city. We find that community engagement is a critical component of promoting the acceptance and use of bike infrastructure and discuss the role of a community bike shop in facilitating community engagement around bicycling in the neighbourhood of Humboldt Park, home to the second largest Puerto Rican community in the USA.},

However, understanding this is highly relevant for policymakers to understand the impacts of their transport decisions. These dimensions include the distribution of mobility and accessibility levels over particular areas or for specific population groups, as well as how this may affect various social outcomes, including their levels of participation, social inclusion and community cohesion. In response, we propose a method to assess the socially relevant accessibility impacts (SRAIs) of policies in some of these key dimensions. The method combines the use of underlying ethics principles, more specifically the theories of egalitarianism and sufficientarianism, in combination with accessibility-based analysis and the Lorenz curve and Gini index. We then demonstrate the method in a case study example. Our suggestion is that policymakers can use these ethical perspectives to determine the equity of their policies decisions and to set minimum standards for local transport delivery. This will help them to become more confident in the development and adoption of new decision frameworks that promote accessibility over mobility and which also disaggregate the costs and benefits of transport policies over particular areas or for specific under-served population groups.},

During the summer of 2014, surveys were mailed to 1537 households near a proposed cycle track on Malcolm X Boulevard in Roxbury, MA. On the Boulevard, intercept surveys were distributed to cyclists and observations noted about passing cyclist's characteristics. Data were analyzed from 252 returned-mailed surveys, 120 intercept surveys, and 709 bicyclists. White (100\%), Hispanic (79\%), and Black (76\%) bicyclists shown pictures of 6 bicycle facility types in intercept surveys perceived the cycle track as safest. More White mailed-survey respondents thought bikes would not be stolen which may explain why more Hispanics (52\%) and Blacks (47\%) preferred to park their bikes inside their home compared with Whites (28\%), with H/W B/W differences statistically significant (p b 0.05). More Hispanic (81\%) and Black (54\%) mailed-survey respondents thought they would bicycle more if they could bicycle with family and friends compared with Whites (40\%). Bicyclists observed commuting morning and evening included Blacks (55\%), Whites (36\%) and Hispanics (9\%). More Whites (68\%) wore helmets compared with Hispanics (21\%) and Blacks (17\%) (p b 0.001). More Blacks (94\%) and Hispanics (94\%) rode a mountain bike compared with Whites (75\%). Minority populations are biking on roads but prefer cycle tracks. They also prefer to park bikes inside their homes and bicycle with family and friends. Wide cycle tracks (bicycling with family/friends) and home bike parking should be targeted as capital investments in lower-income minority neighborhoods.},

  abstract = {Since the 1960s, development of the transport system has been framed by the notion of forecasting future demand. Yet the past decade or more appears to signal some significant changes to the role of travel in society which are having a material impact on how much people travel (and may travel in the future). Coupled with the potential for major technological changes and a range of climate adaptation scenarios, the future of mobility presents today's decision making on transport strategy and investment with a broader set of uncertainties than has previously been considered. This paper examines current mainstream practice for incorporating uncertainty into decision-making, through an illustrative case study of the highly codified approaches of the Department for Transport in England. It deconstructs the issue by first focussing on different ways in which there is an opening out or acceptance of new uncertainties and how this creates a (wider) set of potential futures. It then turns to consider how this set of futures is used, or not, in decision-making, i.e. the process of closing down uncertainty to arrive at or at least inform a decision. We demonstrate that, because the range of uncertainties has broadened in scope and scale, the traditional technocratic approach of closing down decisions through sensitivity testing is at odds with the greater breadth now being called for at the opening out stage. We conclude that transport decision-making would benefit from a rebalancing of technical depth with analytical breadth. The paper outlines a plausible new approach to opening out and closing down that is starting to be applied in practice. This approach must be accompanied by an opening up of the processes by which technical advice for decisions are reached and how uncertainties are understood and negotiated.},

The two policies are highly comparable, offering similar rates for most renewable electricity technologies. Major differences between the policies include the level of differentiation found in the German policy, as well as the use of a price degression strategy for FIT rates in Germany compared to an escalation strategy in Ontario. The German renewable electricity portfolio is relatively balanced, compared to Ontario where wind power dominates the portfolio. At the federal level, Canada does not yet have a policy similar to the European Directive on Renewable Energy, and this lack may impact decisions taken by manufacturers of renewable technologies who consider establishing operations in the province. Ontario's Green Energy and Green Economy Act could be benefit from lessons in the German system, especially with regard to degression of feed-in tariff rates over time, which could significantly reduce payments to producers over the course of a contract, and in turn encourage greater competitiveness among renewable power providers in the future.},

Discussion: The idea of deprivation amplification has some intuitive attractiveness and helps divert attention away from purely individual determinants of diet and physical activity, and towards health promoting or health damaging features of the physical and social environment. Such environmental features may be modifiable, and environmental changes may help promote healthier behaviors. However, recent empirical examination of the distribution of facilities and resources shows that location does not always disadvantage poorer neighbourhoods. This suggests that we need: a) to ensure that theories and policies are based on up-to-date empirical evidence on the socioeconomic distribution of neighbourhood resources, and b) to engage in further research on the relative importance of, and interactions between, individual and environmental factors in shaping behavior.},

  abstract = {Taking the UK as a case study, this paper describes current energy use and a range of sustainable energy options for the future, including solar power and other renewables. I focus on the area involved in collecting, converting and delivering sustainable energy, looking in particular detail at the potential role of solar power. Britain consumes energy at a rate of about 5000 watts per person, and its population density is about 250 people per square kilometre. If we multiply the per capita energy consumption by the population density, then we obtain the average primary energy consumption per unit area, which for the UK is 1.25 watts per square metre. This areal power density is uncomfortably similar to the average power density that could be supplied by many renewables: the gravitational potential energy of rainfall in the Scottish highlands has a raw power per unit area of roughly 0.24 watts per square metre; energy crops in Europe deliver about 0.5 watts per square metre; wind farms deliver roughly 2.5 watts per square metre; solar photovoltaic farms in Bavaria, Germany, and Vermont, USA, deliver 4 watts per square metre; in sunnier locations, solar photovoltaic farms can deliver 10 watts per square metre; concentrating solar power stations in deserts might deliver 20 watts per square metre. In a decarbonized world that is renewable-powered, the land area required to maintain today's British energy consumption would have to be similar to the area of Britain. Several other high-density, high-consuming countries are in the same boat as Britain, and many other countries are rushing to join us. Decarbonizing such countries will only be possible through some combination of the following options: the embracing of country-sized renewable power-generation facilities; large-scale energy imports from country-sized renewable facilities in other countries; population reduction; radical efficiency improvements and lifestyle changes; and the growth of non-renewable low-carbon sources, namely `clean' coal, `clean' gas and nuclear power. If solar is to play a large role in the future energy system, then we need new methods for energy storage; very-large-scale solar either would need to be combined with electricity stores or it would need to serve a large flexible demand for energy that effectively stores useful energy in the form of chemicals, heat, or cold.},

We compared the magnitude of inequalities in mortality and self-assessed health among 22 countries in all parts of Europe. Methods We obtained data on mortality according to education level and occupational class from census-based mortality studies. Deaths were classified according to cause, including common causes, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer; causes related to smoking; causes related to alcohol use; and causes amenable to medical intervention, such as tuberculosis and hypertension. Data on self-assessed health, smoking, and obesity according to education and income were obtained from health or multipurpose surveys. For each country, the association between socioeconomic status and health outcomes was measured with the use of regression-based inequality indexes. Results In almost all countries, the rates of death and poorer self-assessments of health were substantially higher in groups of lower socioeconomic status, but the magnitude of the inequalities between groups of higher and lower socioeconomic status was much larger in some countries than in others. Inequalities in mortality were small in some southern European countries and very large in most countries in the eastern and Baltic regions. These variations among countries appeared to be attributable in part to causes of death related to smoking or alcohol use or amenable to medical intervention. The magnitude of inequalities in self-assessed health also varied substantially among countries, but in a different pattern. Conclusions We observed variation across Europe in the magnitude of inequalities in health associated with socioeconomic status. These inequalities might be reduced by improving educational opportunities, income distribution, health-related behavior, or access to health care.},

  abstract = {Background Successfully increasing cycling across a broad range of the population would confer important health benefits, but many potential cyclists are deterred by fears about traffic danger. Media coverage of road traffic crashes may reinforce this perception. As part of a wider effort to model the system dynamics of urban cycling, in this paper we examined how media coverage of cyclist fatalities in London changed across a period when the prevalence of cycling doubled. We compared this with changes in the coverage of motorcyclist fatalities as a control group. Methods Police records of traffic crashes (STATS19) were used to identify all cyclist and motorcyclist fatalities in London between 1992 and 2012. We searched electronic archives of London's largest local newspaper to identify relevant articles (January 1992\textendash April 2014), and sought to identify which police-reported fatalities received any media coverage. We repeated this in three smaller English cities. Results Across the period when cycling trips doubled in London, the proportion of fatalities covered in the local media increased from 6\% in 1992\textendash 1994 to 75\% in 2010\textendash 2012. By contrast, the coverage of motorcyclist fatalities remained low (4\% in 1992\textendash 1994 versus 5\% in 2010\textendash 2012; p = 0.007 for interaction between mode and time period). Comparisons with other English cities suggested that the changes observed in London might not occur in smaller cities with lower absolute numbers of crashes, as in these settings fatalities are almost always covered regardless of mode share (79\textendash 100\% coverage for both cyclist and motorcyclist fatalities). Conclusion In large cities, an increase in the popularity (and therefore `newsworthiness') of cycling may increase the propensity of the media to cover cyclist fatalities. This has the potential to give the public the impression that cycling has become more dangerous, and thereby initiate a negative feedback loop that dampens down further increases in cycling. Understanding these complex roles of the media in shaping cycling trends may help identify effective policy levers to achieve sustained growth in cycling.},

A transparent life cycle inventory (LCI) was compiled in a component-wise manner for nickel metal hydride (NiMH), nickel cobalt manganese lithium-ion (NCM), and iron phosphate lithium-ion (LFP) batteries. The battery systems were investigated with a functional unit based on energy storage, and environmental impacts were analyzed using midpoint indicators. On a per-storage basis, the NiMH technology was found to have the highest environmental impact, followed by NCM and then LFP, for all categories considered except ozone depletion potential. We found higher life cycle global warming emissions than have been previously reported. Detailed contribution and structural path analyses allowed for the identification of the different processes and value-chains most directly responsible for these emissions. This article contributes a public and detailed inventory, which can be easily be adapted to any powertrain, along with readily usable environmental performance assessments.},

  abstract = {As part of the establishing of mobilities research as a new paradigm, systematic reflections on methodological implications of centre staged mobility have gathered momentum. Currently, the consensus in the debate seems to suggest that a social understanding of mobilities is best analysed through qualitative research methods, which capture the subjective sense, experienced constraints and freedoms and incorporated legitimisation of mobilities and immobilities. However, it is a whole range of numbers and quantified developments which serves as obvious legitimisation of the paradigm change. For its critics, quantitative research is associated with empiricist and positivist assumptions. Yet, in human geography, the last decades have witnessed a vivid debate on the epistemological and theoretical foundation of statistics and quantifications highlighting that equalising quantitative research with positivism is too simplistic. Drawing on this discussion, I will critically reflect on the current focus on qualitative and the ignoring of quantitative methods in mobilities research and outline a post-positivist understanding of quantifications, arguing in favour of also-quantitative methods for mobilities which can help tackling some shortcomings identified in parts of current mobilities research practice. Also from a political point of view, I propose that ``numeracy'' as the speaking of the language of numbers and statistics increases the chance for critique to be heard in policy-making. In addition, it is data literacy and computing skills which form the preconditions for understanding, criticising and conducting research with Big Data which may significantly shape new views on the \textendash{} data-mediated \textendash{} mobile social world beyond narrated textual or survey-based observations.},

In particular, the headquarter of the University of Teramo revealed some structural damages which make necessary to operate a restoration of the buildings. It represents a rare opportunity for investigating possible applications of a cluster of technologies and approaches largely recognized as efficient and high-performing to such particular buildings in order to achieve an upgrading in terms of energy efficiency. The proposal includes the improvement of the exploitation of renewable energy sources through adequate systems, which do not modify the visual perception of the pavilions. In that regards, the required electricity could be produced by a PV roofing installed on the parking area, while a biomass boiler and an absorption chiller could allow supplying the thermal and cooling needs. Furthermore, the rain water recovery system permits to reduce the exploitation of potable water for uses which do not require a high quality, such as irrigation. On the other hand, the envelope energy efficiency could be enhanced by applying passive strategies for reducing the heat losses (winter conditions) and gains (summer conditions) through fa\c{c}ades and roof. The results confirmed the reliability of those interventions and the consequent advantages from an economical and energy point of view.},

  abstract = {Urban planning processes are complex and multidimensional and they require re-thinking of traditional approaches. One of the theories increasingly researched by urban planners is realisation of participatory planning to facilitate public participation. This approach, as an effective bottom-up method, should increase the capabilities of planners to solve urban problems by including the general public in the urban planning process. This paper proposes a framework for a Web-based spatial decision support system (WebGIS-SDSS) adjusted to a participatory urban planning approach. The framework, called Web-based participatory urban planning (WPUP), has been implemented in a case study. It offers a Web-based spatial forum to demonstrate how the proposed system can not only help citizens to share their idea regarding urban plans, but also help planners to implement applicable bottom-up and public participation decision-making theory in the urban planning process. WPUP supports the deliberative and analytic components of the collaborative spatial decision-making process. It facilitates inclusion of local knowledge in urban planning to complement traditional approaches. WPUP provides easy access to urban plans and decisions, improves communication among planners and public, involves citizens' preferences on planning in a timely manner, and finally facilitates participatory planning approach.},

The investigations used a blend of methods including literature review, focus groups, accompanied walks, geographical information system (GIS) mapping and interviews with older people and experts working in the field of transport planning. The findings were tested through a series of practitioner and user workshops.While other studies have also provided valuable evidence on the importance of transport to well-being the article presents evidence as to important cultural aspects of the predominant approach to transport planning which lead to older people's needs not receiving the attention that they need or deserve. There is a lack of training of professionals in the specific needs of this group compounded by a lack of time devoted to understanding these. Efforts to automate the identification of problem areas using GIS mapping do not match well to the problems expressed by older people. This leads us to conclude that a more community-based, user-led approach is most likely to deliver the inclusive transport system that transport planners say they wish to develop and that older people would like to travel on.},

  abstract = {Over the last fifty years, research into street networks has gained prominence with a rapidly growing number of studies across disparate disciplines. These studies investigate a wide range of phenomena using a wealth of data and diverse analytical techniques. Starting within the fields of transport or infrastructure engineering, street networks have commonly been treated as sets of more or less homogeneous linear elements, connecting locations and intersecting at junctions. This view is commonly represented as a graph, which provides a common and rigorous formalisation accessible across disciplines and is particularly well-suited for problems such as flow optimisation and routing. Street networks are, however, complex objects of investigation and the way we model and then represent them as graphs has fundamental effects on the outcomes of a study. Many approaches to modelling street networks have been proposed, each lending itself to different analyses and supporting insights into diverse aspects of the urban system. Yet, this plurality and the relation between different models remains relatively obscure and unexplored. The motivations for adopting a given model of the network are also not always clear and often seem to follow disciplinary traditions. This paper provides an overview of key street network models and the prima facie merits of pertinent alternative approaches. It suggests greater attention to consistent use of terms and concepts, of graph representations and practical applications, and concludes with suggestions for possible ways forward.},

Both tools have been adapted substantially to cope with the challenges posed by the goal of sustainable development. However, the changes have primarily focused on the negative environmental impacts of the transport sector. Hardly any attention has been paid to another key dimension of sustainable development: social justice. This paper critically analyzes the two tools from this perspective. It concludes that transport modeling is implicitly based on the distributive principle of demand. Given the importance of mobility in current society, it is suggested to replace current demand-based approaches by transport modeling that is based on the principle of need. Likewise, costbenefit analysis has a built-in distributive mechanism that structurally favors transport improvements for highly mobile groups. This problem could be solved by replacing travel time savings by so-called accessibility gains as the key benefit taken into account in cost-benefit analysis. If the suggested changes were realized, both transport modeling and cost-benefit analysis could become key tools for promoting sustainable transport.},

This paper makes a moral argument for what would be a fair distribution of these benefits. The argument follows Walzer's ``Spheres of Justice'' approach to define the benefits of transportation, access, as a sphere deserving a separate, non-market driven, distribution. That distribution, we propose, is one where the maximum gap between the lowest and highest accessibility, both by mode and in space, should be limited, while attempting to maximize average access. We then review transportation planning practice for a priori distributional goals and find little explicit guidance in conventional and even justice-oriented transportation planning and analyses. We end with a discussion of the implications for practice.},

  abstract = {While distributive aspects have been a topic of discussion in relation to cost\textendash benefit analysis (CBA), little systematic thought has been given in the CBA literature to the focus of such an equity analysis in evaluating transport projects. The goal of the paper is to provide an overview of the various directions an equity analysis, carried out within the context of a social cost\textendash benefit analysis, could take. The paper starts from the widely-shared definition of distributive justice: the morally proper distribution of goods and bads over members of society. Following this definition, carrying out an equity analysis requires that decisions are made about: (1) the benefits and costs that are distributed through a transport project; (2) the members of society between whom benefits and costs are distributed; and (3) the distributive principle that determines whether a particular distribution is fair. Much of the discussions about cost\textendash benefit analysis and equity do not address these questions in any systematic way. The paper aims to provide a framework. Three sets of benefits and costs are identified as a possible focus of an equity analysis: (1) net benefits; (2) mobility-enhancing benefits; and (3) individual benefits and costs. For each set, a discussion follows regarding the way in which members of societies could be divided into meaningful groups, as well as the possible yardstick for judging whether a certain distribution is fair. While the paper acknowledges that the choice between the three sets is ultimately a political decision, it ends with a set of arguments that suggest that the equity analysis of transport projects should focus first and foremost on the mobility-enhancing benefits generated by such projects.},

  abstract = {Worldwide, concern about physical inactivity and excessive car dependence has encouraged ambitious targets and policies to promote cycling. But policy making is hindered by limited knowledge about why cycling prevalence and trends vary greatly between different geographic areas (e.g. in London (UK) {$<$}1\% cycle to work in Harrow compared to {$>$}15\% in Hackney) and individuals (e.g. by age or gender). The role of cycle infrastructure investment in explaining part of these patterns and trends is also unknown. We linked individual-level data on 317,117 London commuters (including 11,199 cyclists) in the 2001 and 2011 UK Census to relevant geographic data, including on area-level cycling infrastructure investment during the period. Whilst cycle commuting increased over time on average, concentration curves and indices demonstrated that in contrast with England as a whole, cycling in London shifted from being dominated by commuters with lower socioeconomic status to commuters with higher socioeconomic status. In our first set of regression analyses, we showed that observed differences and time trends in cycling prevalence were partially explained by area-level differences in topography, greenspace, footpaths and crime levels and by differences and changes in population structures. In the second, we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis which showed that expenditure on cycling infrastructure was associated with increased cycling at a marginal rate of \textsterling 4,915 per additional commuter cyclist, with some variation between groups: ethnic minorities were more responsive, and females, older people and those with lower socioeconomic status appeared less responsive. If planned increases in expenditure in England for the period 2020-25 were as cost-effective, and were sustained for the whole decade, our study suggests that cycling prevalence could increase in England by 0.5 to 1.1 percentage points. More research is necessary to determine whether such investment in cycling infrastructure constitutes good or equitable value for money.},

  abstract = {Context Financial incentives, including taxes and subsidies, can be used to encourage behavior change. They are common in transport policy for tackling externalities associated with use of motor vehicles, and in public health for influencing alcohol consumption and smoking behaviors. Financial incentives also offer policymakers a compromise between ``nudging,'' which may be insufficient for changing habitual behavior, and regulations that restrict individual choice. Evidence acquisition The literature review identified studies published between January 1997 and January 2012 of financial incentives relating to any mode of travel in which the impact on active travel, physical activity, or obesity levels was reported. It encompassed macroenvironmental schemes, such as gasoline taxes, and microenvironmental schemes, such as employer-subsidized bicycles. Five relevant reviews and 20 primary studies (of which nine were not included in the reviews) were identified. Evidence synthesis The results show that more-robust evidence is required if policymakers are to maximize the health impact of fiscal policy relating to transport schemes of this kind. Conclusions Drawing on a literature review and insights from the SLOTH (sleep, leisure, occupation, transportation, and home-based activities) time-budget model, this paper argues that financial incentives may have a larger role in promoting walking and cycling than is acknowledged generally.},

The work explores two different self-driving vehicle concepts \textendash{} a ridesharing system (Shared Taxi), which emulates a taxi-like system where customers accept small detours from their original direct path and share part of their ride with others and a dynamic bus-like service with minibuses (Taxi-Bus), where customers pre-book their service at least 30min in advance (permanent bookings for regular trips should represent most requests) and walk short distances to a designated stop. Under the premise that the ``upgraded'' system should as much as possible deliver the same trips as today in terms of origin, destination and timing, and that it should also replace all car and bus trips, it looks at impacts on car fleet size, volume of travel and parking requirements. Mobility output and CO2 emissions are also detailed in two different time scales (24h. average and peak-hour only). The obtained results suggest that a full implementation scenario where the existing metro service is kept and private car, bus and taxi mobility would be replaced by shared modes would significantly reduce travelled vehicle.kilometres and CO2 emissions.},

These data, which mainly consist of proportions or percentages of disjoint categories, are widely known as compositional data and are common in areas such as ecology, geology, and psychology. We provide both the theoretical foundations and a description of how this Laplace approximation can be implemented in the case of Dirichlet regression. The paper also introduces the package dirinla in the R-language that extends the R-INLA package, which can not deal directly with multivariate likelihoods like the Dirichlet likelihood. Simulation studies are presented to validate the good behaviour of the proposed method, while a real data case-study is used to show how this approach can be applied.},

We used the distribution of the entire population and cyclists (total and non-responsible) involved in road crashes in Spain between 1993 and 2009 held by the Spanish National Institute of Statistics and the Spanish General Traffic Directorate to calculate rates of exposure and involvement in a crash. Males aged 45-49 years were used as the reference category to obtain exposure rate ratios (ERR) and unadjusted crash rate ratios (URR). We then used these values in decomposition analysis to calculate crash rate ratios adjusted for exposure (ARR). The pattern of ARR was substantially different from URR. In both sexes the highest values were observed in the youngest age groups, and the values decreased as age increased except for a slight increase in the oldest age groups. In males, a slight increase in the lowest and highest age categories was observed for crashes resulting in severe injury or death, and a decrease was observed for the youngest cyclists who were wearing a helmet. The large differences between age and sex groups in the risk of involvement in a cycling crash are strongly dependent on differences in their exposure rates. Taking exposure rates into account, cyclists younger than 30 years and older than 65 years of age had the highest risk of being involved in a crash.},

We study the interaction of learning-by-doing spillovers with the substitution elasticity between a clean and a dirty sector to evaluate the robustness of policies averting the carbon lock-in. We find that the substitution possibilities between the two sectors have an ambivalent effect: although a high substitution elasticity requires less aggressive mitigation policies than a low one, it creates a greater welfare loss through the lock-in in the absence of regulation. The socially optimal policy response consists of a permanent carbon tax as well as a learning subsidy for clean technologies. We thus indicate that the policy implications of (Acemoglu, D., Aghion, P., Bursztyn, L., Hemous, D., 2012. The Environment and Directed Technical Change. American Economic Review 120 (1): 131\textendash 166), calling for merely temporary interventions based on the mechanism of directed technical change in the same setting, are limited in scope. Our results also highlight that infrastructure provision is crucial to facilitate the low-carbon transformation.},

Information about physical activity and relevant covariates was obtained by interview. Proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals. Exercise and cycling for transportation were both inversely and independently associated with all-cause mortality (p(trend) {$<$} 0.05), but walking for transportation was less strongly associated with reduced risk (p(trend) = 0.07). Women reporting no regular exercise but who reported 10 or more metabolic equivalent (MET)-hours/day of nonexercise activity were at 25-50\% reduced risk (p(trend) {$<$} 0.01) relative to less active women (0-9.9 MET-hours/day). Among women reporting the least nonexercise activity (0-9.9 MET-hours/day) but reporting regular exercise participation, exercise was associated with reduced mortality (hazard ratio = 0.78, 95\% confidence interval: 0.62, 0.99). These findings add new evidence that overall physical activity levels are an important determinant of longevity, and that health benefit can be obtained through an active lifestyle, exercise, or combinations of both.},

  abstract = {Traditional measures of housing affordability are expressed solely as a function of housing cost and income. This one-dimensional view of affordability ignores transportation costs, which represent a sizable proportion of household expenditure. Conventional measures are problematic due to the extent to which housing location influences transportation costs. Consequently, narrowly construed definitions of housing affordability are misleading indicators of housing stress. This study quantitatively examines intra-metropolitan combined housing and transport affordability in Auckland, New Zealand. The research utilises disaggregate zonal data to develop comprehensive indicators of commuting costs. These indicators are applied to give an integrated affordability index for each statistical area unit within Auckland City. The results suggest that once commuting costs are incorporated into measures, a very different pattern of affordability emerges.},

Building on previous research, we define and operationalise three dimensions of vulnerability: exposure (the cost burden of motor fuel), sensitivity (income) and adaptive capacity (accessibility with modes alternative to the car). We exploit unique data sets available in England, including the 'MOT' vehicle inspection data and DfT Accessibility Statistics. This allows us to map vulnerability to fuel price increases at a spatially disaggregated level (Lower-layer Super Output Areas), taking into account motor-fuel expenditure for all travel purposes, and the ability of households to shift to other modes of travel. This is an advancement on the 'oil vulnerability' indices developed in previous international research.},

  abstract = {Research on car dependence exposes the difficulty of moving away from a car-dominated, high-carbon transport system, but neglects the political-economic factors underpinning car-dependent societies. Yet these factors are key constraints to attempts to `decouple' human well-being from energy use and climate change emissions. In this critical review paper, we identify some of the main political-economic factors behind car dependence, drawing together research from several fields. Five key constituent elements of what we call the `car-dependent transport system' are identified: i) the automotive industry; ii) the provision of car infrastructure; iii) the political economy of urban sprawl; iv) the provision of public transport; v) cultures of car consumption. Using the `systems of provision' approach within political economy, we locate the part played by each element within the key dynamic processes of the system as a whole. Such processes encompass industrial structure, political-economic relations, the built environment, and cultural feedback loops. We argue that linkages between these processes are crucial to maintaining car dependence and thus create carbon lock-in. In developing our argument we discuss several important characteristics of car-dependent transport systems: the role of integrated socio-technical aspects of provision, the opportunistic use of contradictory economic arguments serving industrial agendas, the creation of an apolitical fa\c{c}ade around pro-car decision-making, and the `capture' of the state within the car-dependent transport system. Through uncovering the constituents, processes and characteristics of car-dependent transport systems, we show that moving past the automobile age will require an overt and historically aware political program of research and action.},

  abstract = {OIL: THE NEXT REVOLUTION THE UNPRECEDENTED UPSURGE OF OIL PRODUCTION CAPACITY AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE WORLD LEONARDO MAUGERI JUNE Contrary to what most people believe, oil supply capacity is growing worldwide at such an unprecedented level that it might outpace consumption. This could lead to a glut of overproduction and a steep dip in oil prices. Based on original, bottom-up, field-by-field analysis of most oil exploration and development projects in the world, this paper suggests that an unrestricted, additional production (the level of production targeted by each single project, according to its schedule, unadjusted for risk) of more than 49 million barrels per day of oil (crude oil and natural gas liquids, or NGLs) is targeted for 2020, the equivalent of more than half the current world production capacity of 93 mbd. After adjusting this substantial figure considering the risk factors affecting the actual accomplishment of the projects on a country-by-country basis, the additional production that could come by 2020 is about 29 mbd. Factoring in depletion rates of currently producing oilfields and their ``reserve growth'' (the estimated increases in crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids that could be added to existing reserves through extension, revision, improved recovery efficiency, and the discovery of new pools or reservoirs), the net additional production capacity by 2020 could be 17.6 mbd, yielding a world oil production capacity of 110.6 mbd by that date \textendash{} as shown in Figure 1. This would represent the most significant increase in any decade since the 1980s.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the potential for making deep cuts in US transportation greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the long-term (50-80\% below 1990 levels by 2050). Scenarios are used to envision how such a significant decarbonization might be achieved through the application of advanced vehicle technologies and fuels, and various options for behavioral change. A Kaya framework that decomposes GHG emissions into the product of four major drivers is used to analyze emissions and mitigation options. In contrast to most previous studies, a relatively simple, easily adaptable modeling methodology is used which can incorporate insights from other modeling studies and organize them in a way that is easy for policymakers to understand. Also, a wider range of transportation subsectors is considered here-light- and heavy-duty vehicles, aviation, rail, marine, agriculture, off-road, and construction. This analysis investigates scenarios with multiple options (increased efficiency, lower-carbon fuels, and travel demand management) across the various subsectors and confirms the notion that there are no "silver bullet" strategies for making deep cuts in transport GHGs. If substantial emission reductions are to be made, considerable action is needed on all fronts, and no subsectors can be ignored. Light-duty vehicles offer the greatest potential for emission reductions; however, while deep reductions in other subsectors are also possible, there are more limitations in the types of fuels and propulsion systems that can be used. In all cases travel demand management strategies are critical; deep emission cuts will not likely be possible without slowing growth in travel demand across all modes. Even though these scenarios represent only a small subset of the potential futures in which deep reductions might be achieved, they provide a sense of the magnitude of changes required in our transportation system and the need for early and aggressive action if long-term targets are to be met. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Reflecting the need for even minor programming in today's model-based statistics, the book pushes readers to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated. This unique computational approach ensures that readers understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in their own modeling work.  The text presents generalized linear multilevel models from a Bayesian perspective, relying on a simple logical interpretation of Bayesian probability and maximum entropy. It covers from the basics of regression to multilevel models. The author also discusses measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and network autocorrelation.  By using complete R code examples throughout, this book provides a practical foundation for performing statistical inference. Designed for both PhD students and seasoned professionals in the natural and social sciences, it prepares them for more advanced or specialized statistical modeling.  Web ResourceThe book is accompanied by an R package (rethinking) that is available on the author's website and GitHub. The two core functions (map and map2stan) of this package allow a variety of statistical models to be constructed from standard model formulas.},

  abstract = {One of the prevailing challenges in cycling research, or indeed any vulnerable road user research, is the availability of data to ascertain a representative level of `exposure' or simply how much cycling there is \textendash{} ``when and where''. Therefore, it is difficult for researchers and ultimately local authorities to determine if changes in observed accident trends over time are due to increased accident risk, (users or environment becomes more unsafe) or if they are a function of the higher numbers of cyclists using the existing roads and routes resulting in more incidents, i.e. increased exposure. This paper describes the use of recently developed open source transport modelling software and an open source bike routing application to assign realistic cycling flows to the network and validation against observed network link flows. The cyclist flows then provide the `exposure' variable to examine cyclist safety performance at macro and meso levels using global and local models. The results highlight the need for local level mobility-based exposure metric to describe cyclist safety performance and the superior ability of local models to describe safety performance of cyclists in urban contexts, where more frequently used population based, and global models mask urban spatial patterns and safety performance.},

  abstract = {In the years following her role as the lead author of the international bestseller,Limits to Growththe first book to show the consequences of unchecked growth on a finite planet Donella Meadows remained a pioneer of environmental and social analysis until her untimely death in 2001. Meadows newly released manuscript,Thinking in Systems, is a concise and crucial book offering insight for problem solving on scales ranging from the personal to the global. Edited by the Sustainability Institutes Diana Wright, this essential primer brings systems thinking out of the realm of computers and equations and into the tangible world, showing readers how to develop the systems-thinking skills that thought leaders across the globe consider critical for 21st-century life. Some of the biggest problems facing the worldwar, hunger, poverty, and environmental degradationare essentially system failures. They cannot be solved by fixing one piece in isolation from the others, because even seemingly minor details have enormous power to undermine the best efforts of too-narrow thinking. While readers will learn the conceptual tools and methods of systems thinking, the heart of the book is grander than methodology. Donella Meadows was known as much for nurturing positive outcomes as she was for delving into the science behind global dilemmas. She reminds readers to pay attention to what is important, not just what is quantifiable, to stay humble, and to stay a learner. In a world growing ever more complicated, crowded, and interdependent,Thinking in Systemshelps readers avoid confusion and helplessness, the first step toward finding proactive and effective solutions.},

  abstract = {The number and the temporal and spatial distribution of work locations are crucial information for any transport demand model. To generate the initial transport demand of MATSim, an activity-based multiagent simulation framework, it is necessary to determine dynamic workplace capacities with high spatial resolution, either on a parcel or even a building level. Commonly applied methods to derive work locations are based on census of enterprises information, unemployment insurance database, or combined information of a building's gross floor area and individual work space requirements. As an alternative, the authors present a methodology that combines public transport smart card transaction data, travel diary surveys, and building information data sources. Work activities are detected from smart card transactions based on observed activity duration and start time and therefore related to public transport stops. To link the observed work activities to individual buildings, a linear programming optimization technique is applied that minimizes the walking time between public transport stops and potential work locations. The method classifies work activities in representative work schedules obtained by clustering methods. Information on maximum allowed building gross floor area derived from land use regulation is combined with estimates on individual work space requirements to ensure that buildings are only assigned with work activities according to their maximal capacity. To account for private transport based work activities, mode shares as observed in a travel diary are taken into account. To demonstrate the applicability, the proposed approach is implemented in Singapore and the results critically reviewed.},

Educators interested in improving online learning can benefit from understanding formal and informal feedback flows existing in face-to-face environments and how these transfer online. This article examines the nuance of informal feedback in education and how this is impacted by online delivery. A variety of techniques were situated along a spectrum from face-to-face to online delivery, and informal to formal assessment types. Four main themes for facilitating informal feedback with online delivery were identified: Type 1 - increased emphasis on formal formative assessment; Type 2 - facilitating alternative `face-to-face' experiences; Type 3 - manual analysis of unstructured learner generated data; and Type 4 - automated experiences. Recommendations for course designers, implications for CDIO institutions and organisation were discussed, including blended learning projects, online communities of practice, data sharing and advocacy opportunities.},

  abstract = {More than 100 countries have adopted a global warming limit of 2 degrees C or below (relative to pre-industrial levels) as a guiding principle for mitigation efforts to reduce climate change risks, impacts and damages. However, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions corresponding to a specified maximum warming are poorly known owing to uncertainties in the carbon cycle and the climate response. Here we provide a comprehensive probabilistic analysis aimed at quantifying GHG emission budgets for the 2000-50 period that would limit warming throughout the twenty-first century to below 2 degrees C, based on a combination of published distributions of climate system properties and observational constraints. We show that, for the chosen class of emission scenarios, both cumulative emissions up to 2050 and emission levels in 2050 are robust indicators of the probability that twenty-first century warming will not exceed 2 degrees C relative to pre-industrial temperatures. Limiting cumulative CO(2) emissions over 2000-50 to 1,000 Gt CO(2) yields a 25\% probability of warming exceeding 2 degrees C-and a limit of 1,440 Gt CO(2) yields a 50\% probability-given a representative estimate of the distribution of climate system properties. As known 2000-06 CO(2) emissions were approximately 234 Gt CO(2), less than half the proven economically recoverable oil, gas and coal reserves can still be emitted up to 2050 to achieve such a goal. Recent G8 Communiqu\'es envisage halved global GHG emissions by 2050, for which we estimate a 12-45\% probability of exceeding 2 degrees C-assuming 1990 as emission base year and a range of published climate sensitivity distributions. Emissions levels in 2020 are a less robust indicator, but for the scenarios considered, the probability of exceeding 2 degrees C rises to 53-87\% if global GHG emissions are still more than 25\% above 2000 levels in 2020.},

Prolonged strenuous PA performed on a regular basis causes an increase in overall energy turnover, and leads either to loss of body weight, or to an increased food intake. When leading to loss of body weight, PA may be used as a therapeutic adjunct in the treatment of obesity. When increasing food intake to compensate for increased energy expenditure and maintaining body weight, PA, by increasing intake of other constituents of food like minerals and vitamins, may contribute to micronutrient deficiency coverage. However, the type of activity, as well as body composition of the individuals engaging in sport, play an important role in food intake regulation and its changes with time. Some studies indicate that short-term exercise does not have the same effect on food intake as long-term exercise and that eventual increase in food intake due to increased PA does not follow the same pattern in obese as in lean individuals. To better understand the relationship between PA on food intake, current findings on this topic will be summarized in this paper.},

  abstract = {The Brazilian city of Curitiba has long been recognised as an exemplary success in urban planning, particularly its sustainable urban transport, with modal splits strongly favouring public transit. Its success was achieved principally through rigorous and detailed planning, beginning in the 1970s, using policy tools that have been described, and sometimes criticised, as technocratic. After 40 years of a quite successful experience in transport planning and implementation, Curitiba, like many world cities, faces new challenges, particularly in the form of metropolitanisation and increased aspirations for citizen participation. In this paper we investigate which policy tools are being used to face these emerging challenges in Curitiba, whether they are the same as those used in the past and which led the city to be a recognised urban transport success case, or different, more flexible and participative tools presumed to be more in tune with the emerging context of metropolitanisation and increased demands for participation. The answer, coming from interviews within Curitiba transport representatives, current literature review and limited comparisons with other successful transport cities of the Americas, suggests a continuation of Curitiba's proactive format, one which has led to its past successes, with some modest overtures to more interactive and participatory policy tools.},

The moderating role of age, gender, socio-economic status and country on these associations was also investigated. Overall, results showed that people living in neighbourhoods with a preponderance of speed limits below 30 km/h, many bicycle lanes, with less traffic calming devices, more trees, more litter and many parked cars forming an obstacle on the road were more likely to cycle for transport than people living in areas with lower prevalence of these factors. Evidence was only found for seven out of 56 possible moderators of these associations. These results suggest that reducing speed limits for motorized vehicles and the provision of more bicycle lanes may be effective interventions to promote cycling in Europe.},

Within the international project Assessing Time Use Survey Datasets several potentially useful individual US time use heritage datasets have been identified for use in de-veloping an historical series of non-market accounts. In order to evaluate the series of American Heritage Time Use Data (AHTUD) (1965, 1975, 1985, 1992-94, 1998-99) this paper analyses the representativeness of this data when using given weights and provides a new harmonised calibration of the AHTUD for sound time use analyses. Our calibration procedure with its ADJUST program package is theoretically founded on information theory, consistent with a simultaneous weighting including hierarchical data, ensures desired positive weights, and is well-suited and available for any time use data calibration of interest. We present the calibration approach and provide new harmonised weights for all AHTUD surveys based on a substantially driven calibration frame-work. To illustrate the various application possibilities of a calibration, we finally disentangle demographic vs. time use behavioural changes and developments by re-calibrating all five AHTUD surveys using 1965 popula-tion totals as a benchmark.},

  abstract = {Small multiples enable comparison by providing different views of a single data set in a dense and aligned manner. A common frame defines each view, which varies based upon values of a conditioning variable. An increasingly popular use of this technique is to project two-dimensional locations into a gridded space (e.g. grid maps), using the underlying distribution both as the conditioning variable and to determine the grid layout. Using whitespace in this layout has the potential to carry information, especially in a geographic context. Yet, the effects of doing so on the spatial properties of the original units are not understood. We explore the design space offered by such small multiples with gaps. We do so by constructing a comprehensive suite of metrics that capture properties of the layout used to arrange the small multiples for comparison (e.g. compactness and alignment) and the preservation of the original data (e.g. distance, topology and shape). We study these metrics in geographic data sets with varying properties and numbers of gaps. We use simulated annealing to optimize for each metric and measure the effects on the others. To explore these effects systematically, we take a new approach, developing a system to visualize this design space using a set of interactive matrices. We find that adding small amounts of whitespace to small multiple arrays improves some of the characteristics of 2D layouts, such as shape, distance and direction. This comes at the cost of other metrics, such as the retention of topology. Effects vary according to the input maps, with degree of variation in size of input regions found to be a factor. Optima exist for particular metrics in many cases, but at different amounts of whitespace for different maps. We suggest multiple metrics be used in optimized layouts, finding topology to be a primary factor in existing manually-crafted solutions, followed by a trade-off between shape and displacement. But the rich range of possible optimized layouts leads us to challenge single-solution thinking; we suggest to consider alternative optimized layouts for small multiples with gaps. Key to our work is the systematic, quantified and visual approach to exploring design spaces when facing a trade-off between many competing criteria\textemdash an approach likely to be of value to the analysis of other design spaces.},

Despite the evidence, transportation planning practice does not fully account for this phenomenon, with the result that estimates of the potential congestion-reducing benefits of added highway capacity may be overstated and estimates of potential environmental impacts understated. In 2015, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) sponsored a review of applicable induced vehicle travel research that could inform transportation analysis guidance in response to new laws in California such as Senate Bill 743 (S.B. 743), which prohibits the use of vehicle level of service (LOS) and similar measures as the sole basis for determining significant transportation impacts under the California Environmental Quality Act. Instead, vehicle miles traveled was selected to replace LOS under S.B. 743, and along with the new metric there will be a requirement to account for induced travel effects in analysis of roadway capacity expansion projects. The Caltrans review revealed an inconsistent lexicon in academic research and among practitioners, questions about research applicability, limitations in the sensitivity of travel forecasting models, and confusion about the appropriate use of induced vehicle travel elasticities from research. This paper summarizes the Caltrans review and shares the findings to advance understanding of induced vehicle travel effects and suggest steps for additional research.},

Little is known about patterns of active travel or associated cardiovascular health benefits in low- and middle-income countries. This study examines mode and duration of travel to work in rural and urban India and associations between active travel and overweight, hypertension, and diabetes.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: Cross-sectional study of 3,902 participants (1,366 rural, 2,536 urban) in the Indian Migration Study. Associations between mode and duration of active travel and cardiovascular risk factors were assessed using random-effect logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex, caste, standard of living, occupation, factory location, leisure time physical activity, daily fat intake, smoking status, and alcohol use. Rural dwellers were significantly more likely to bicycle (68.3\% versus 15.9\%; p{$<$}0.001) to work than urban dwellers. The prevalence of overweight or obesity was 50.0\%, 37.6\%, 24.2\%, 24.9\%; hypertension was 17.7\%, 11.8\%, 6.5\%, 9.8\%; and diabetes was 10.8\%, 7.4\%, 3.8\%, 7.3\% in participants who travelled to work by private transport, public transport, bicycling, and walking, respectively. In the adjusted analysis, those walking (adjusted risk ratio [ARR] 0.72; 95\% CI 0.58-0.88) or bicycling to work (ARR 0.66; 95\% CI 0.55-0.77) were significantly less likely to be overweight or obese than those travelling by private transport. Those bicycling to work were significantly less likely to have hypertension (ARR 0.51; 95\% CI 0.36-0.71) or diabetes (ARR 0.65; 95\% CI 0.44-0.95). There was evidence of a dose-response relationship between duration of bicycling to work and being overweight, having hypertension or diabetes. The main limitation of the study is the cross-sectional design, which limits causal inference for the associations found.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nCONCLUSIONS: Walking and bicycling to work was associated with reduced cardiovascular risk in the Indian population. Efforts to increase active travel in urban areas and halt declines in rural areas should be integral to strategies to maintain healthy weight and prevent NCDs in India.

  abstract = {The primary aim of this study was to analyse the significance of household temperature in determining the amount of potential energy savings taken back in the form of an increase in the comfort temperature following energy efficiency improvements. If the dual goals of energy conservation and affordable warmth for low-income households are to be attained, the nature of takeback must be more thoroughly understood so that the full benefit of energy efficiency measures can be assessed along with the carbon/energy savings. However, very little analysis has been carried out to quantify the benefit taken as warmth. This research examines the results of a number of monitored energy efficiency projects undertaken in Britain over the past 20 years to try to determine the most important influences on temperature takeback. The main findings are:\textbullet{} the internal temperature is the main determinant on the amount of benefit from energy efficiency measures that will be taken as an increase in comfort rather than as an energy saving; \textbullet{} at 16.5\textdegree C, the current average temperature of housing in Great Britain, about 30\% of the benefit of an energy efficiency improvement would be taken as a temperature increase and the rest as an energy saving; \textbullet{} at temperatures as low as 14\textdegree C \textemdash{} still frequently found in low-income households \textemdash{} only half of the energy saving will be achieved and the remainder would be taken as a temperature increase; \textbullet{} 20\textdegree C is the most likely whole house comfort temperature in an energy efficient house and it is only in these circumstances that further improvements will achieve the full energy saving; \textbullet{} there has been a narrowing of the gap in average indoor winter temperatures of the different tenure types and tenure alone is no longer a definitive indicator of household temperature; \textbullet{} living room temperature is not a good indicator in the UK of whole house average temperature, as a warm living room may be found in an otherwise cold house, particularly in low-income households without central heating; \textbullet{} as there is now little difference between the average temperatures of local authority and owner occupied households, there should be little difference in the overall degree of takeback between these two tenures; \textbullet{} energy efficiency measures which increase radiant temperature, such as double glazing, enable the occupants to be comfortable at a lower air temperature and thus reduce the degree of takeback by up to 20\%; \textbullet{} there is a lack of suitably monitored and analysed projects to enable a rigorous assessment of takeback, particularly for higher income households; \textbullet{} the present low levels of warmth and slow rate of improvement in average temperatures will mean that investment in the energy efficiency of the UK housing stock will fail to achieve the predicted energy savings for at least another 15 years.},

We report age- and sex-specific deaths and injury rates from equivalent incidents in England by travel mode, distance travelled and time spent travelling.    Methods  Hospital admissions and deaths in England 2007\textendash 2009 were obtained for relevant ICD-10 external codes for pedestrians, cyclists, and car/van drivers, by age-group and sex. Distance travelled by age-group, sex and mode in England (National Travel Survey 2007\textendash 2009 data) was converted to time spent travelling using mean trip speeds. Fatality rates were compared with age-specific Netherlands data.    Results  All-age fatalities per million hours' use (f/mhu) varied over the same factor-of-three range for both sexes (0.15\textendash 0.45 f/mhu by mode for men, 0.09\textendash 0.31 f/mhu for women). Risks were similar for men aged 21\textendash 49 y for all three modes and for female pedestrians and drivers aged 21\textendash 69 y. Most at risk were: males 17\textendash 20 y (1.3 f/mhu (95\% CI 1.2\textendash 1.4)) for driving; males 70+ (2.2 f/mhu(1.6\textendash 3.0)) for cycling; and females 70+ (0.95 f/mhu (0.86\textendash 1.1)) for pedestrians. In general, fatality rates were substantially higher among males than females. Risks per hour for male drivers \&lt;30 y were similar or higher than for male cyclists; for males aged 17\textendash 20 y, the risk was higher for drivers (33/Bn km (30\textendash 36), 1.3 f/mhu (1.2\textendash 1.4)) than cyclists (20/Bn km (10\textendash 37), 0.24 f/mhu (0.12\textendash 0.45)) whether using distance or time. Similar age patterns occurred for cyclists and drivers in the Netherlands. Age-sex patterns for injuries resulting in hospital admission were similar for cyclists and pedestrians but lower for drivers.    Conclusions  When all relevant ICD-10 codes are used, fatalities by time spent travelling vary within similar ranges for walking, cycling and driving. Risks for drivers were highest in youth and fell with age, while for pedestrians and cyclists, risks increased with age. For the young, especially males, cycling is safer than driving.},

This paper reports the development of a suite of tools to measure and value community severance, undertaken as a part of the Street Mobility and Network Accessibility research project. The tools include participatory mapping, spatial analysis, a video survey, street audits, a health and neighbourhood mobility survey, and a valuation tool based on a stated preference survey. They were tested in the area around Finchley Road, a busy arterial road in North London. The study found that Finchley Road is an unpleasant place for pedestrians due to high traffic levels, air and noise pollution, and the lack and poor quality of pedestrian crossing facilities. This has a negative impact on the mobility and accessibility of local residents and, to some extent, on their health and wellbeing. The analysis showed coherence between the findings from the different measurement tools applied individually, but also revealed interconnections between factors which contribute to severance, demonstrating that overall the suite is reliable for assessing community severance in urban areas. Overall, the paper provides a multidisciplinary approach to developing standardised methods to measure a negative impact of transport that is still relatively unknown.},

The rolling resistance and air resistance of each vehicle were assessed. The mechanical internal work (W(INT)) was measured from three-dimensional motion analysis of the Hobby Horse and modern bicycle moving on a treadmill at different speeds. The equation obtained from the modern bicycle data was applied to the other vehicles. We found the following results. (i) Apart from the Rover, which was introduced for safety reasons, every newly invented bicycle improved metabolic economy. (ii) The rolling resistance decreased with subsequent designs while the frontal area and, hence, aerodynamic drag was fairly constant (except for the High Wheeler). (iii) The saddle-assisted body weight relief (which was inaugurated by the Hobby Horse) was responsible for most of the reduction in metabolic cost compared with walking or running. Further reductions in C were due to decreases in stride/pedalling frequency and, hence, W(INT) at the same speeds. (iv) The introduction of gear ratios allowed the use of pedalling frequencies that optimize the power/contraction velocity properties of the propulsive muscles. As a consequence, net mechanical efficiency (the ratio between the total mechanical work and C) was almost constant (0.273 +/- 0.015s.d.) for all bicycle designs, despite the increase in cruising speed. In the period from 1820 to 1890, improved design of bicycles increased the metabolically equivalent speed by threefold compared with walking at an average pace of ca. + 0.5 ms(-1) per decade [corrected]. The speed gain was the result of concurrent technological advancements in wheeled, human-powered vehicles and of 'smart' adaptation of the same actuator (the muscle) to different operational conditions.},

Binomial logistic regressions of school travel mode choice for children aged 11\textendash 12 years, in the City of Toronto, Canada, were estimated, using six spatial units for measuring built environment characteristics. The results were suggestive of the presence of MAUP across different geographical units. Travel distance, block density, signalized intersections, walking density, and schools in low-income neighborhoods were associated with active travel. This research improves understanding of the sensitivity of school travel behavior analyses to the spatial representation of the neighborhood construct.},

The assessment methodology uses AIM/End-use model with a detailed characterization of technologies to analyze two scenarios for India and China till the year 2050. The first scenario assumes continuation and enhancement, in both countries, of policies under a typical business-as-usual dynamics, like constructing metros, implementing national fuel economy standards, promoting alternate fuel vehicles and implementing national air quality standards. The alternative, low carbon scenario assumes application, in both countries, of globally envisaged measures like fuel economy standards as well as imposition of carbon price derived from a global integrated assessment modeling exercise aiming to achieve global 2\textdegree C temperature stabilization target. The modeling results for both countries show that decarbonizing transport sector shall need a wide array of measures including fuel economy, low carbon fuel mix including low carbon electricity supply. The comparison of China and India results provides important insights and lessons from their similarities and differences in the choice of urban transport options. India can benefit from China's experiences as it lags China in urbanization and income. Modeling assessments show that both nations can contribute to, as well as benefit by aligning their transport plans with global climate stabilization regime.},

But, active modes of transport are not zero emitters. We aimed to quantify GHG emissions from food production required to fuel extra physical activity for walking and cycling. We estimate the emissions (in kgCO2e) per kilometre travelled for walking and cycling from energy intake required to compensate for increased energy expenditure, and data on food-related GHG emissions. We assume that persons who shift from passive modes of transport (e.g. driving) have increased energy expenditure that may be compensated with increased food consumption. The GHG emissions associated with food intake required to fuel a kilometre of walking range between 0.05\,kgCO2e/km in the least economically developed countries to 0.26\,kgCO2e/km in the most economically developed countries. Emissions for cycling are approximately half those of walking. Emissions from food required for walking and cycling are not negligible in economically developed countries which have high dietary-related emissions. There is high uncertainty about the actual emissions associated with walking and cycling, and high variability based on country economic development. Our study highlights the need to consider emissions from other sectors when estimating net-emissions impacts from transport interventions.},

In this respect, this study presents a modified methodology based on data mining techniques for constructing sidewalk geometries using multiple GPS traces collected by wheelchair users during an urban travel experiment. The derived sidewalk geometries can be used to enrich OpenStreetMap to support wheelchair routing. The proposed method was applied to a case study in Heidelberg, Germany. The constructed sidewalk geometries were compared to an official reference dataset (``ground truth dataset''). The case study shows that the constructed sidewalk network overlays with 96\% of the official reference dataset. Furthermore, in terms of positional accuracy, a low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value (0.93 m) is achieved.

This level of integration allows choosing housing locations from which workplaces of all household members are accessible. In addition, discretionary travel can be limited to a household's travel budget after mandatory trips have been completed. The model is expected to represent travel and housing location choice constraints more realistically under high congestion/high cost scenarios.},

  abstract = {For over 30 years, an argument has been proceeding among researchers who have analysed trends in urban traffic conditions, with notable contributions from Downs, Thomson, Smeed, Zahavi, Bly, Webster and the author. The argument has been rather theoretical, but has an important policy issue at its heart: if urban road capacity is increased, does this result in some improvement in traffic speeds (as traffic engineers have hoped), or does it make congestion worse (as many urban authorities now suspect)? Resolving this question depends on explaining the ubiquitous observations that there is a very wide variation in day-to-day running speeds for individual vehicles on particular journeys, but there is only slight long-term change in average traffic speeds, in spite of the substantial growth in car ownership and the many different transport policies which have been adopted. This paper reviews the views and empirical evidence that have been put forward to date, and defends the conclusion that the counter-intuitive argument is in fact correct: increasing road capacity in congested conditions can make congestion worse. The reason for this lies in the interaction between private and public transport, or rather between individual and collective transport. An important policy conclusion follows: a necessary condition for increasing journey speeds in towns (for both car users and collective transport users) is to improve the quality of collective transport. Sample calculations suggest that the average direct journey speed in central London may be more than doubled by such a policy.},

To the contrary, we suggest that travel has an intrinsic positive utility and is valued for its own sake, not just as a means of reaching a destination. We argue that the same positive characteristics that lead people to engage in travel as a recreational activity in itself, are likely to motivate them to engage in apparently excess travel in the context of their mandatory and maintenance activities as well. This paper explores the conceptual basis of a positive utility for travel, and presents some results from an ongoing empirical study of attitudes toward travel. In modeling distance traveled (in each of 11 categories), we found that subjective variables such as Travel Liking, the adventure-seeker Personality trait, the travel stress Attitudinal factor, and the Excess Travel indicator added considerable explanatory power to the Demographic variables traditionally used in such models. It appears that, far from being completely determined by demographically-based needs, the amount of travel demanded is heavily influenced by one's attitudes toward travel. This is not only true for discretionary (entertainment) purposes as would be expected, but for more ``mandatory'' purposes such as work/school-related activities as well. We are convinced that the demand for travel arises from a fundamental human need for mobility and other subjective characteristics, as well as from the external causes typically measured. To more accurately forecast travel demand and policy response, the role of those subjective characteristics needs to be understood much better than we do at present.},

Given inherent methodological complexities in the evaluation of such changes, it is important to understand whether study results obtained depend on the study design and methods used, and to describe the implications of the methods used for causality. The aims of this systematic review were to summarize the effects obtained in studies that used a wide range of study designs to assess the effects of infrastructural interventions on cycling and physical activity, and whether the effects varied by study design, data collection methods, or statistical approaches. Methods: Six databases were searched for studies that evaluated infrastructural interventions to promote cycling in adult populations, such as the opening of cycling lanes, or the expansion of a city-wide cycling network. Controlled and uncontrolled studies that presented data before and after the intervention were included. No language or date restrictions were applied. Data was extracted for any outcome presented (e.g. bikes counted on the new infrastructure, making a bike trip, cycling frequency, cycling duration), and for any purpose of cycling (e.g. total cycling, recreational cycling, cycling for commuting). Data for physical activity outcomes and equity effects was extracted, and quality assessment was conducted following previous methodologies and the UK Medical Research Council guidance on natural experiments. The PROGRESS-Plus framework was used to describe the impact on subgroups of the population. Studies were categorized by outcome, i.e. changes in cycling behavior, or usage of the cycling infrastructure. The relative change was calculated to derive a common outcome across various metrics and cycling purposes. The median relative change was presented to evaluate whether effects differed by methodological aspects. Results: The review included 31 studies and all were conducted within urban areas in high-income countries. Most of the evaluations found changes in favor of the intervention, showing that the number of cyclists using the facilities increased (median relative change compared to baseline: 62\%; range: 4 to 438\%), and to a lesser extent that cycling behavior increased (median relative change compared to baseline: 22\%; range: - 21 to 262\%). Studies that tested for statistical significance and studies that used subjective measurement methods (such as surveys and direct observations of cyclists) found larger changes than those that did not perform statistical tests, and those that used objective measurement methods (such as GPS and accelerometers, and automatic counting stations). Seven studies provided information on changes of physical activity behaviors, and findings were mixed. Three studies tested for equity effects following the opening of cycling infrastructure. Conclusions: Study findings of natural experiments evaluating infrastructural interventions to promote cycling depended on the methods used and the approach to analysis. Studies measuring cycling behavior were more likely to assess actual behavioral change that is most relevant for population health, as compared to studies that measured the use of cycling infrastructure. Triangulation of methods is warranted to overcome potential issues that one may encounter when evaluating environmental changes within the built environment. Trial registration: The protocol of this study was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42018091079).},

These spillovers occur over a wide spatial field and are strongest after a lag, suggesting that they reflect migration behavior. In addition, highly localized spatial interactions are found, consistent with commuting adjustments in response to shocks. Incorporating these effects eliminates spatial autocorrelation from the residuals.

An 8-month follow-up cross-sectional study (September 2010\textendash April 2011) was carried out among undergraduate students during the first season of implementation of the PBSP in Valencia, Spain. The sample was 173 students (68.2\% female) with a mean age of 21.3 years (SD 3.06) who attended a PBSP promotional session. The data were collected by questionnaire. Results indicated a significant increase of 14.6\% in the action/maintenance stage of change and showed that 19\% of the participants were PBSP users 8 months later. The behavioral stage did not change when students always had access to car/motorbike, lived further than 5 km from the university and had no bicycle stations within 250 m from home. Those most likely to start using PBSP were students who were in the contemplation stage, perceived fewer environmental and safety barriers to active commuting and had one or more stations within 250 m of home. PBSP users expended {$\sim$}257 metabolic equivalent{$\cdot$}minutes/week bicycling to university, and there was a small reduction in BMI. Findings suggest that PBSPs can be considered as useful promoters of cycling behavior and may contribute to weight control in university students.},

  abstract = {Walkability audits provide valuable information about pedestrian environments, but are time-consuming and can be expensive to implement. In this paper, we propose a model-based approach to select sites for conducting walkability audits. The key idea is to estimate a model of travel behavior at the meso-scale level, which can be examined to identify locations where the behavior is under- and over-estimated. We conjecture that systematic under- and over-estimation can be caused by micro-level factors that influence the behavior. The results can be used to identify sites for walkability audits. The approach is demonstrated with a case study in Hamilton, Canada. A model of walk shares forms the basis of the site selection procedure. After identifying areas with higher and lower shares than predicted by the model we select a sample of neighborhoods for audits. Analysis of the results reveals elements of the local environment that associate with greater-than-expected walk shares. The case study demonstrates that the proposed model-based strategy can be used to better target limited resources, and produce valuable insights into micro-level factors that affect travel behavior.},

  abstract = {Data visualisation is becoming an established way to drive discovery and develop theory and hypotheses among researchers. Data visualisations can also serve as tools for knowledge translation with policy makers, who are increasingly using data and evidence to inform and implement policy. For obesity policy, data visualisation tools can help policy makers and other professionals understand the socio-spatial distribution of risk factors and quantify social and environmental conditions that are recognised upstream determinants of diet, activity and obesity. The demand for and use of data visualisation tools can be driven by an identified policy need, which can be met by researchers and data scientists. Alternatively, researchers are developing and testing data visualisations, which may be subsequently adapted for, and adopted by policy users. Two recently-released interactive data visualisation tools in the UK illustrate these points. The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) was developed with funding from the UK government to inform the investment of cycling infrastructure in England. The Food environment assessment tool (Feat) evolved as a translational output from a programme of epidemiological research. This article uses PCT and Feat as case studies, drawing parallels and contrasts between them. We discuss these two tools from policy context and scientific underpinnings, to product launch and evaluation. We review challenges inherent in the development and dissemination of data tools for policy, including the need for technical expertise, feedback integration, long-term sustainability, and provision of training and user support. Finally, we attempt to derive learning points that may help overcome challenges associated with the creation, dissemination and sustaining of data tools for policy. We contend that, despite a number of challenges, data tools provide a novel gateway between researchers and a range of stakeholders, who are seeking ways of accessing and using evidence to inform obesity programs and policies.},

A commitment of all general practitioners to implement a smoking cessation intervention will result in a similar health gain. Stimulating commuter cycling could be a promising example of intersectoral health policy.

  abstract = {Statistical analysis of point processes often assumes that the underlying process is isotropic in the sense that its distribution is invariant under rotation. For point processes on {$\mathbb{R}$}2, some tests based on the K- and nearest neighbour orientation functions have been proposed to check such an assumption. However, anisotropy and directional analysis need proper caution when dealing with point processes on linear networks, as the implicit geometry of the network forces particular directions that the points of the pattern have to necessarily meet. In this paper, we adapt such tests to the case of linear networks, and discuss how to use them to detect particular directional preferences, even at some angles that are different from the main angles imposed by the network. Through a simulation study, we check the performance of our proposals under different settings, over a linear network and a dendrite tree, showing that they are able to precisely detect the directional preferences of the points in the pattern, regardless the type of spatial interaction and the geometry of the network. We use our tests to highlight the directional preferences in the spatial distribution of traffic accidents in Barcelona (Spain) during 2019, and in Medellin (Colombia), during 2016.},

We examined the extent to which differential traffic volume and road geometry can explain social inequalities in pedestrian, cyclist, and motor vehicle occupant injuries across wealthy and poor urban areas. Methods. We performed a multilevel observational study of all road users injured over 5 years (n = 19 568) at intersections (n = 17 498) in a large urban area (Island of Montreal, Canada). We considered intersection-level (traffic estimates, major roads, number of legs) and area-level (population density, commuting travel modes, household income) characteristics in multilevel Poisson regressions that nested intersections in 506 census tracts. Results. There were significantly more injured pedestrians, cyclists, and motor vehicle occupants at intersections in the poorest than in the richest areas. Controlling for traffic volume, intersection geometry, and pedestrian and cyclist volumes greatly attenuated the event rate ratios between intersections in the poorest and richest areas for injured pedestrians (\textendash 70\%), cyclists (\textendash 44\%), and motor vehicle occupants (\textendash 44\%). Conclusions. Roadway environment can explain a substantial portion of the excess rate of road traffic injuries in the poorest urban areas.

This paper sheds light on the transport-education inequality nexus with reference to school accessibility by public transport in the SPMR. To assess school accessibility, we develop an accessibility index which combines information on the spatial distribution of adolescents, the location of existing schools, and the public transport provision serving the school catchment area into a single measure. The index is used to measure school accessibility locally across 633 areas within the SPMR. We use the index to simulate the impact of a policy aiming at increasing the centralisation of public secondary education provision, and find that it negatively affects public transport accessibility for students with the lowest levels of accessibility. These results illustrate how existing inequalities can be amplified by variable accessibility to schools across income groups and geographical space. The research suggests that educational inequality impacts of school agglomeration policies should be considered before centralisation takes place.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty older (age 61-79) overweight men and 71 such women with 2 or more risk factors (ie, systolic BP 130-179 mmHg, non-fasting blood glucose 110-139 mg/dl, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 120-219 mg/dl) participated in a 6-month exercise intervention. The exercise program consisted of moderate-intensity bicycle exercise for approximately 40 min, performed on average 2.5 times per week. Systolic and diastolic BP reductions were found to be greater in women than in men (SBP, -10.6 vs. -5.5 mmHg; DBP, -6.2 vs. -3.3 mmHg; both P{$<$}0.05). Decreases in body mass index were larger in women than in men (P{$<$}0.05). There was no significant gender difference in the changes in blood glucose and lipid profiles and hsCRP levels. After adjustment for confounders (exercise frequency, weight loss, age, and baseline values), there were still significant gender differences in the SBP and DBP reductions. hsCRP reduction were similar in both genders even after adjusting for weight loss. CONCLUSIONS: There could be gender differences in the beneficial effects of exercise training on the potent CV risk factors of BP and body weight, but not on hsCRP.},

National agencies often have reliable traffic count data for major roads, but for residential areas served by minor roads, especially at national scale, such information is often not available or incomplete. Here we present a method to predict AADT at the national scale for minor roads, using a routing algorithm within a geographical information system (GIS) to rank roads by importance based on simulated journeys through the road network. From a training set of known minor road AADT, routing importance is used to predict AADT on all UK minor roads in a regression model along with the road class, urban or rural location and AADT on the nearest major road. Validation with both independent traffic counts and noise measurements show that this method gives a considerable improvement in noise prediction capability when compared to models that do not give adequate consideration to minor road variability (Spearman's rho. increases from 0.46 to 0.72). This has significance for epidemiological cohort studies attempting to link noise exposure to adverse health outcomes.},

Although this relationship is central to biodiversity and biogeography, its theoretical underpinnings remain poorly understood. Here, we develop a general framework to describe how the distance\textendash decay relationship is influenced by population aggregation and the landscape-scale species-abundance distribution. We utilize this general framework and data from three tropical forests to show that rare species have a weak influence on distance\textendash decay curves, and that overall similarity and rates of decay are primarily influenced by species abundances and population aggregation respectively. We illustrate the utility of the framework by deriving an exact analytical expression of the distance\textendash decay relationship when population aggregation is characterized by the Poisson Cluster Process. Our study provides a foundation for understanding the distance\textendash decay relationship, and for predicting and testing patterns of beta-diversity under competing theories in ecology., Ecology Letters (2008) 11: 904\textendash 917},

The research reported in this paper provides guidance on this issue through a case study appraisal of the experiences that existing members have with the London Bicycle Sharing Scheme. This appraisal focuses on how the quality of service is perceived by members, their overall level of satisfaction with the scheme, their behavioural intentions toward renewing their memberships, and their willingness to recommend the scheme to others. A market segmentation analysis is produced which identifies the presence of four heterogeneous member groups. These member segments are profiled according to their demographic, psychographic, and behavioural characteristics. Through a detailed appreciation of the defining features of these member segments, strategies are proposed which are tailored to their specific needs and expectations.},

  abstract = {The London Congestion Charge (LCC) is a transport policy with a precise spatial footprint. As such, its impact on the transport system can be expected to vary over space, providing an opportunity to explore the geographical reach of local transport interventions. This paper assesses whether the exemption of Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) from the LCC affected the registration rate of these vehicles in Greater London and the surrounding areas. The analysis uses official data on the number of HEVs registered across the local authorities of the United Kingdom. This dataset is assessed using [1] exploratory spatial analysis to determine the degree of spatial variation in HEV registrations, [2] area classifications to consider if HEV registrations diminish as nearness to the LCC recedes, and [3] spatial regression models to evaluate the association between distance to the LCC and HEV registrations, controlling for other area characteristics (i.e. socioeconomic, household, and transport system variables). The results clearly show that nearness to the LCC is positively associated with HEV registrations, implying that this form of transport policy is effective at promoting the adoption of low emission vehicles.},

  abstract = {Car fleets across much of Europe have undergone a process of dieselisation over the past 20 years. Understanding the factors driving this process is therefore important for sustainable transport policy, with implications for how governments steer their national car fleets towards ultra-low emission vehicles in the future. At a general level, this paper contributes to this wider body of work which aims to understand the factors which led to the transition from petrol to diesel. Specifically, the paper investigates whether the availability of relatively cheap diesel fuel in the Republic of Ireland affected the rate of diesel car ownership in Northern Ireland. A geographic approach is used, which involves generating spatial variables measuring nearness to the Republic of Ireland and comparing these with the proportion of the local car stock that is fuelled by diesel. A series of spatial regression models are specified to determine if this association between nearness to the Republic and diesel ownership persists after accounting for the effect of socioeconomic, travel, and household characteristics. The results support the hypothesis that the availability of cheaper fuel in the Republic of Ireland is not only generating fuel-tourism, but is also affecting the structure of the car fleet registered in Northern Ireland. The findings are relevant beyond the case study and imply that the structure of a country's car fleet is not only dependent on domestic policies, but is also affected by the policies of neighbouring countries.},

Bicycling for transportation is a modality of physical activity that people can incorporate easily into their daily lives. A qualitative study using 11 semi-structured individual interviews and 5 focus groups was conducted among 31 male and 13 female adult residents of Bogot찼, Colombia in 2006. The study explored barriers and facilitators of bicycle use for transportation purposes. People were selected based on socioeconomic status, age, and gender. Thematic analysis complemented with thematic network analysis was used to analyze the data. Six main themes emerged from the study: (1) general acknowledgment of individual and collective benefits of bicycle use; (2) built environment conditions were linked with bicycle use; (3) some social factors affect bicycling negatively; (4) people perceived conflicts over public space related to the use of bike-paths;( 5) general negative public perception of bicyclists; and (6) gender differences influence patterns of bicycle use. The findings from this qualitative study show that various social and physical barriers must be addressed to increase bicycle use as a means of transportation in Bogot찼.},

  abstract = {This study presents empirical insights into Dutch citizens' preferences for spatial equality in the context of decision-making regarding the composition of a national transport investment plan. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first study worldwide which empirically investigates citizens' preferences for the spatial distribution of benefits accruing from a transport investment plan. We conducted two Stated Choice experiments: one involving an investment plan for travel time savings, the other involving an investment plan for traffic safety. Our results show that in the context of travel time savings, a vast majority of citizens has a strong preference for spatial equality. When the investment program involves traffic safety improvements, the share of citizens that has a preference for spatial equality is considerably smaller. Specifically, using a Latent class discrete choice analysis we identified distinct segments. The first segment has a very strong preference for the investment program having the largest total reduction in traffic deaths; the second segment assigns a substantial value to an equal distribution of reductions of traffic deaths across the Netherlands. Highly educated citizens are found to have a relatively strong preference for spatial equality as compared to low educated citizens. Contrary to our expectations, explanatory variables such as political orientation, income, car ownership and region of residence do not appear to associate with citizens' preferences for spatial equality.},

However, risks of injury from exposure to motorized traffic and their emissions (i.e. air pollution) exist. The objective was to systematically review studies conducting health impact assessment (HIA) of a mode shift to AT on grounds of associated health benefits and risks. Methods Systematic database searches of MEDLINE, Web of Science and Transportation Research International Documentation were performed by two independent researchers, augmented by bibliographic review, internet searches and expert consultation to identify peer-reviewed studies from inception to December 2014. Results Thirty studies were included, originating predominantly from Europe, but also the United States, Australia and New Zealand. They compromised of mostly HIA approaches of comparative risk assessment and cost\textendash benefit analysis. Estimated health benefit\textendash risk or benefit\textendash cost ratios of a mode shift to AT ranged between -2 and 360 (median=9). Effects of increased PA contributed the most to estimated health benefits, which strongly outweighed detrimental effects of traffic incidents and air pollution exposure on health. Conclusion Despite different HIA methodologies being applied with distinctive assumptions on key parameters, AT can provide substantial net health benefits, irrespective of geographical context.},

We modeled the association between cycling network length and cycling mode share and estimated health impacts of the expansion of cycling networks. First, we performed a non-linear least square regression to assess the relationship between cycling network length and cycling mode share for 167 European cities. Second, we conducted a quantitative HIA for the seven cities of different scenarios (S) assessing how an expansion of the cycling network [i.e. 10\% (S1); 50\% (S2); 100\% (S3), and all-streets (S4)] would lead to an increase in cycling mode share and estimated mortality impacts thereof. We quantified mortality impacts for changes in physical activity, air pollution and traffic incidents. Third, we conducted a cost\textendash benefit analysis. The cycling network length was associated with a cycling mode share of up to 24.7\% in European cities. The all-streets scenario (S4) produced greatest benefits through increases in cycling for London with 1210 premature deaths (95\% CI: 447\textendash 1972) avoidable annually, followed by Rome (433; 95\% CI: 170\textendash 695), Barcelona (248; 95\% CI: 86\textendash 410), Vienna (146; 95\% CI: 40\textendash 252), Zurich (58; 95\% CI: 16\textendash 100) and Antwerp (7; 95\% CI: 3\textendash 11). The largest cost\textendash benefit ratios were found for the 10\% increase in cycling networks (S1). If all 167 European cities achieved a cycling mode share of 24.7\% over 10,000 premature deaths could be avoided annually. In European cities, expansions of cycling networks were associated with increases in cycling and estimated to provide health and economic benefits.},

  abstract = {Tropical arid to semi-arid ecosystems are nearly as diverse as more humid forests and occupy large parts of the tropics. In comparison, however, they are vastly understudied. For instance, fog precipitation alone supports a unique vegetation formation, locally termed lomas, on coastal mountains in the Peruvian desert. To effectively protect these highly endemic and threatened ecosystems, we must increase our understanding of their diversity patterns in relation to environmental factors. Consequently, we recorded all vascular species from 100 random 4~\texttimes ~4~m plots on the fog-exposed southern slope of the mountain Mong\'on. We used topographic and remotely sensed covariates in statistical models to generate spatial predictions of alpha diversity and plant species' distribution probabilities. Altitude was the most important predictor in all models and may represent fog moisture levels. Other significant covariates in the models most likely refer also to water availability but on a finer spatial scale. Additionally, model-based clustering revealed five altitudinal vegetation zones. This study contributes to a better spatial understanding of the biodiversity and spatial arrangement of vegetation belts of the largely unknown but highly unique lomas formations. Furthermore, mapping species richness and plant species' distributions could support a long-needed lomas strategic conservation scheme.},

Over the past two decades, several PPGIS initiatives have taken place in the western and non-western world. Several avenues have opened up, but nonetheless, questions regarding the effectiveness of such initiatives remain to be answered. Current research addressing the societal and political impacts of GIS have witnessed novel use of the technology and specialized spatial data provision such as volunteered geographic information, neogeography, geoweb, and map~2.0 (Goodchild, ; Elwood ; Sui ) and have received increased attention from GIS scholars (Goodchild ; Elwood ; Sui ). A common thread tying such specialized use of technology is the participation by citizens with little or no GIS training, a long standing objective of the PPGIS area of inquiry. So, as we move into an era that is gravitating rapidly toward more specialized use of technology built on a similar foundation, it seems timely to reflect on the effectiveness and sustainability of PPGIS initiatives. This article reviews the history of PPGIS, its genesis, and some of the critical work within the PPGIS research arena. Finally, the paper reflects on where PPGIS stands today.},

High rates of death and injury coupled with reporting of poor infrastructure and fear of the behaviour of other road users point to a plausible prima facie concern that pedestrians and cyclists suffer inequalities. Yet this appearance masks uncertainty about what factors are relevant in judging inequality and how these should be treated against potentially competing claims. This article develops a framework assessing conditions for walking and cycling according to a theoretical conception of political and social equality, and so providing a basis on which to make arguments for change in transport policy, planning and law. In developing the framework we examine the relevance to equality of a range of factors, including measurement of road casualties, questions of responsibility to increase walking and cycling as means of contributing to pollution and carbon reduction, matters of fault and responsibility for road safety, and the economic impacts of improving conditions for walking and cycling.},

  abstract = {Given its contribution to congestion, pollution, and energy consumption and the complex and changing characteristics of delivery routes, the modeling of urban freight transport is a difficult, highly data-demanding and often unreliable task. Extending other previous works that focused only on the morning peak hour, the authors have developed a trip generation model by using the available data to their maximum extent and adding other parameters that can be found through simple surveys. This trip generation model is then included as part of a four-stage process, with the trip distribution solved through entropy maximization and resulting in the estimation of an origin-destination matrix for freight transport in a city. The application to a case study in the city of Seville and the validation with on-street vehicle counts shows reasonably robust results and provides a simple and effective tool to analyze urban freight deliveries from a macroscopic point of view.

We investigated the association between active transport to work and incidence of myocardial infarction.DesignThis ecological study of 325 local authorities in England included 43,077,039 employed individuals aged 25?74 years (UK Census, 2011), and 117,521 individuals with myocardial infarction (Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project, 2011?2013).MethodsBayesian negative binomial regression models were used to investigate the association of active transport to work and incidence of myocardial infarction adjusting for local levels of deprivation, obesity, smoking, diabetes and physical activity.ResultsIn 2011, the prevalence of active transportation to work for people in employment in England aged 25?74 years was 11.4\% (4,531,182 active transporters; 8.6\% walking and 2.8\% cycling). Active transport in 2011 was associated with a reduced incidence of myocardial infarction in 2012 amongst men cycling to work (incidence rate ratio (95\% credible interval) 0.983 (0.967?0.999); and women walking to work (0.983 (0.967?0.999)) after full adjustments. However, the prevalence of active transport for men and women was not significantly associated with the combined incidence of myocardial infarction between 2011?2013 after adjusting for physical activity, smoking and diabetes.ConclusionsIn England, the prevalence of active transportation was associated with a reduced incidence of myocardial infarction for women walking and men cycling to work in corresponding local geographic areas. The overall association of active transport with myocardial infarction was, however, explained by local area levels of smoking, diabetes and physical activity.},

We developed indices and maps of global hidden hunger to help prioritize program assistance, and to serve as an evidence-based global advocacy tool. Two types of hidden hunger indices and maps were created based on i) national prevalence data on stunting, anemia due to iron deficiency, and low serum retinol levels among preschool-aged children in 149 countries; and ii) estimates of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) attributed to micronutrient deficiencies in 136 countries. A number of countries in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as India and Afghanistan, had an alarmingly high level of hidden hunger, with stunting, iron deficiency anemia, and vitamin A deficiency all being highly prevalent. The total DALY rates per 100,000 population, attributed to micronutrient deficiencies, were generally the highest in sub-Saharan African countries. In 36 countries, home to 90\% of the world's stunted children, deficiencies of micronutrients were responsible for 1.5-12\% of the total DALYs. The pattern and magnitude of iodine deficiency did not conform to that of other micronutrients. The greatest proportions of children with iodine deficiency were in the Eastern Mediterranean (46.6\%), European (44.2\%), and African (40.4\%) regions. The current indices and maps provide crucial data to optimize the prioritization of program assistance addressing global multiple micronutrient deficiencies. Moreover, the indices and maps serve as a useful advocacy tool in the call for increased commitments to scale up effective nutrition interventions.},

  abstract = {The central concern of this paper is the relationship between research-driven ``state-of-the-art'' knowledge, and knowledge claims made in practice, in planning for sustainability. The paper approaches this topic from a critical realist perspective, which is used to provide criteria for positing ``state-of-the-art'' knowledge validity, and assessing the quality of situated knowledge claims in planning practice. In this way the paper contributes to debates about an ontological turn in planning knowledge. By reviewing key planning documents in three Scandinavian city regions, the paper shows that the knowledge claims about travel behavioral impacts of proposed land use and transport infrastructure presented in the documents are, to varying extents, in accordance with ``state-of-the-art'' academic knowledge on these topics. Some long-standing ``planning myths'' are encountered in the investigated planning documents. In one of the cities, residential and workplace location close to suburban public transport stops is highlighted as a traffic-reducing measure, rather than proximity to inner-city concentrations of jobs and other facilities, and density is discussed at a neighborhood scale rather than at a city scale. In all three cities, planning documents depict road capacity increases as having no traffic-generating effect. These latter claims are used in support of more decentralized land-use patterns and considerable road development. Since the likelihood of achieving sustainability goals relies heavily on whether the measures chosen are productive or counter-productive, knowledge obviously matters. A stronger focus on how well suited proposed strategies for spatial development are to produce their purported outcomes should be welcomed in planning research and practice.},

  abstract = {Preface: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established jointly by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to assess periodically the science, impacts, and socio-economics of climate change and of adaptation and mitigation options. The IPCC provides, on request, scientific and technical advice to the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its bodies. In response to a 1994 evaluation of the earlier IPCC IS92 emissions scenarios, the 1996 Plenary of the IPCC requested this Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) (see Appendix I for the Terms of Reference). This report was accepted by the Working Group III (WGIII) plenary session in March 2000. The long-term nature and uncertainty of climate change and its driving forces require scenarios that extend to the end of the 21st century. This report describes the new scenarios and how they were developed. The SRES scenarios cover a wide range of the main driving forces of future emissions, from demographic to technological and economic developments. As required by the Terms of Reference, none of the scenarios in the set includes any future policies that explicitly address climate change, although all scenarios necessarily encompass various policies of other types. The set of SRES emissions scenarios is based on an extensive assessment of the literature, six alternative modelling approaches, and an "open process" that solicited wide participation and feedback from many groups and individuals. The SRES scenarios include the range of emissions of all relevant species of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and sulfur and their driving forces. The SRES writing team included more than 50 members from 18 countries who represent a broad range of scientific disciplines, regional backgrounds, and non-governmental organizations (see Appendix II). The team, led by Nebojsa Nakicenovic of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Austria, included representatives of six scenario modeling groups and lead authors from all three earlier IPCC scenario activities - the 1990 and 1992 scenarios and the 1994 scenario evaluation. The SRES preparation included six major steps: analysis of existing scenarios in the literature; analysis of major scenario characteristics, driving forces, and their relationships; formulation of four narrative scenario "storylines" to describe alternative futures; quantification of each storyline using a variety of modelling approaches; an "open" review process of the resultant emission scenarios and their assumptions; and three revisions of the scenarios and the report subsequent to the open review process, i.e., the formal IPCC Expert Review and the final combined IPCC Expert and Government Review. As required by the Terms of Reference, the SRES preparation process was open with no single "official" model and no exclusive "expert teams." To this end, in 1997 the IPCC advertised in relevant scientific journals and other publications to solicit wide participation in the process. A web site documenting the SRES process and intermediate results was created to facilitate outside input. Members of the writing team also published much of their background research in the peer-reviewed literature and on web sites. In June 1998, the IPCC Bureau agreed to make the unapproved, preliminary scenarios available to climate modelers, who could use the scenarios as a basis for the assessment of climatic changes in time for consideration in the IPCC's Third Assessment Report. We recommend that the new scenarios be used not only in the IPCC's future assessments of climate change, its impacts, and adaptation and mitigation options, but also as the basis for analyses by the wider research and policy community of climate change and other environmental problems.},

Although this method may produce acceptable results, it may also be true that the final design could be improved - and the construction efficiency could be enhanced - by a more comprehensive review of the available options in relation to the objectives of the intervention. Such objectives may include accident reduction, modal shift in favour of cycling, health benefits or strategic expansion of a network. This article presents work undertaken to demonstrate a holistic approach to CNP, based on a logically defined spatio-temporal model and allowing some semi-automated multiobjective optimization of network designs in a GIS-based decision-support system. The model is introduced briefly before a case study applying this model to development of a cycle network in a small town in northeast England is described. The results obtained from this case study and the implications of this research for cycle network planners are discussed. \textcopyright{} 2005 Taylor \& Francis.},

Recent field studies have made progress in elucidating the mechanisms behind these patterns and the implications of these patterns for recruitment success. Together with the development and refinement of mathematical models, this promises a deeper, more mechanistic understanding of dispersal processes and their consequences.},

  abstract = {We examine a novel mathematical approach which posits that the decay of similarity in community composition with increasing distance (aka distance decay) can be modeled as the sum of individual species joint-probability vs distance relationships. Our model, supported by analyses of these curves from three datasets (North American breeding birds, North American taiga plants, and tropical forest trees), suggest that when sampling grain is large enough to avoid absences due to stochastic sampling effects, and/or sampling extent is large enough to generate species turnover through the deterministic crossing of environmental and/or geographical range limits, species joint-probability over increasing distance will generally exhibit exponential decay. However, at small scales where occurrence is driven more by stochastic sampling effects, species joint-probability curves exhibit a power-law decay form. Lacking a theoretical prediction of how individual species joint-probability relationships combine to generate community distance decay, we also performed a meta-analysis of 26 ecological and 4 human-system datasets, using non-linear regression to mean and quantile non-linear regression at tau = 0.95 for linear, exponential, and power-law decay forms. These analyses demonstrate that the functional form of community distance decay \textendash{} as shown by comparison of AIC ranks \textendash{} is largely determined by observational scale, with power law decay prevailing within domains where the species pool remains constant, while exponential decay prevails at larger scales over which the species pool varies, paralleling the patterns predicted in our mathematical approach.},

  abstract = {There are many public health benefits to cycling, such as chronic disease reduction and improved air quality. Real and perceived concerns about safety are primary barriers to new ridership. Due to limited forums for official reporting of cycling incidents, lack of comprehensive data is limiting our ability to study cycling safety and conduct surveillance. Our goal is to introduce BikeMaps.org, a new website developed by the authors for crowd-source mapping of cycling collisions and near misses. BikeMaps.org is a global mapping system that allows citizens to map locations of cycling incidents and report on the nature of the event. Attributes collected are designed for spatial modeling research on predictors of safety and risk, and to aid surveillance and planning. Released in October 2014, within 2 months the website had more than 14,000 visitors and mapping in 14 countries. Collisions represent 38\% of reports (134/356) and near misses 62\% (222/356). In our pilot city, Victoria, Canada, citizens mapped data equivalent to about 1 year of official cycling collision reports within 2 months via BikeMaps.org. Using report completeness as an indicator, early reports indicate that data are of high quality with 50\% being fully attributed and another 10\% having only one missing attribute. We are advancing this technology, with the development of a mobile App, improved data visualization, real-time altering of hazard reports, and automated open-source tools for data sharing. Researchers and citizens interested in utilizing the BikeMaps.org technology can get involved by encouraging citizen mapping in their region.},

Prior research has primarily examined the learning benefits that result from the receipt of feedback reviews, with few studies specifically exploring the merits of producing feedback reviews or the learning mechanisms that this activates. Using accounts of their experiences of peer review, this study illuminates students' perceptions of the different learning benefits resulting from feedback receipt and feedback production, and, importantly, it provides insight into the cognitive processes that are activated when students construct feedback reviews. The findings show that producing feedback reviews engages students in multiple acts of evaluative judgement, both about the work of peers, and, through a reflective process, about their own work; that it involves them in both invoking and applying criteria to explain those judgements; and that it shifts control of feedback processes into students' hands, a shift that can reduce their need for external feedback. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. It is argued that the capacity to produce quality feedback is a fundamental graduate skill, and, as such, it should receive much greater attention in higher education curricula.},

The data and analysis were prepared to include measures at different spatial scales, including measures of density/accessibility and infrastructure provision for network distances from up to 1 km to up to 5 km from the origin of a trip, as well as the regional position of the city. The probability of cycling is affected by urban structure variables at the local, urban and regional scale. The local scale, which includes the positive effects from population density and cycling infrastructures, is the most important in influencing cycling, but there are substantial additional contributions from access to retail and train stations within a range of 3\textendash 4 km, as well as from the relative size of the city within the region. The effect of the regional scale most likely reflects the reliance upon motorized modes to connect to distant important nodes. Factors at the local, urban and regional scales may pull cycling in opposite directions and thus all need to be considered to adequately assess the possibilities for promoting cycling in an urban area or neighbourhood.},

It provides access to both the opportunities and the basic services we rely on each day. However, the benefits of transportation investments have not always been distributed equally among communities (Foth, Manaugh, \& El-Geneidy, 2013; Bullard, 2003). This paper develops a means by which equity objectives for bicycle equity may be appraised using geographic information systems (GIS) and demographic information to spatially identify disadvantaged groups in relation to bicycle infrastructure. In order to demonstrate these methods, Chicago, IL is used as a case study in which its bicycle network is analyzed to determine whether the benefits of its bicycle infrastructure are equitably distributed. Methods include the creation of a Bicycle Equity Index (BEI), a composite measure that uses common indicators of disadvantage such as race/ethnicity, class, and travel characteristics and the application of access coverage measures in GIS. Findings demonstrate that in some cases populations in most need of alternative transportation options are receiving less benefit from access to bicycle networks. The methodology proposed in this paper provides planners with additional context regarding social equity in bicycle planning and may serve as the basis for future community discussions related to current and future planning efforts.},

  abstract = {The fight for the future of the city street between pedestrians, street railways, and promoters of the automobile between 1915 and 1930. Before the advent of the automobile, users of city streets were diverse and included children at play and pedestrians at large. By 1930, most streets were primarily a motor thoroughfares where children did not belong and where pedestrians were condemned as "jaywalkers." In Fighting Traffic, Peter Norton argues that to accommodate automobiles, the American city required not only a physical change but also a social one: before the city could be reconstructed for the sake of motorists, its streets had to be socially reconstructed as places where motorists belonged. It was not an evolution, he writes, but a bloody and sometimes violent revolution. Norton describes how street users struggled to define and redefine what streets were for. He examines developments in the crucial transitional years from the 1910s to the 1930s, uncovering a broad anti-automobile campaign that reviled motorists as "road hogs" or "speed demons" and cars as "juggernauts" or "death cars." He considers the perspectives of all users-pedestrians, police (who had to become "traffic cops"), street railways, downtown businesses, traffic engineers (who often saw cars as the problem, not the solution), and automobile promoters. He finds that pedestrians and parents campaigned in moral terms, fighting for "justice." Cities and downtown businesses tried to regulate traffic in the name of "efficiency." Automotive interest groups, meanwhile, legitimized their claim to the streets by invoking "freedom"-a rhetorical stance of particular power in the United States. Fighting Traffic offers a new look at both the origins of the automotive city in America and how social groups shape technological change.},

Improvements in cycling infrastructure are associated with higher overall cycling rates, but less is known about bike lane utilization in low-income urban neighborhoods. Methods: During the summer of 2009, 4 Central Brooklyn streets with bicycle lanes were studied using camcorders to record for a total of 40 hours. Video recordings were coded for behaviors and characteristics of cyclists and motorists. An intercept survey (N = 324, 42\% participation rate) captured information on cyclist demographics, behaviors, and attitudes. Results: 1282 cyclists were observed on study streets. Cyclists were primarily male (80.0\%) and non-White (54.5\%). 9.9\% of motorists drove in the bike lane and parked vehicles blocked the bike lane for 9.6\% of the observational period. Of cyclists surveyed, 69.4\% lived locally, 61.3\% were normal weight or underweight, and 64.8\% met recommended levels of physical activity by cycling 30+ minutes/day on 5+ days of the past week. Conclusions: Bicycle lanes were used by local residents of a low-income urban neighborhood. Compared with neighborhood residents overall, cyclists reported better health and health behaviors. Enhancing infrastructure that supports active transportation may be effective in reducing health inequities in low-income urban communities.},

A large number of individuals (n= 179) worked with an online public participation geographic information system (PPGIS) platform during a month-long field experiment about regional transportation improvement decision making in the central Puget Sound area of Washington. The system platform logged more than 120,000 client-server interaction events. We developed a geovisual analytic technique called a grapevine to evaluate the quality and scale of public participation using event log data. The grapevine 4D space-time geographic information system (GIS) visualization helps distinguish productive clusters of analytic-deliberative process and for guiding content analysis of the user-generated discussion. Comparison of the nature and content of participant message exchanges before and after GIS-based analytic activities revealed a significant shift in focus. We characterize this shift in the focus of deliberation as the result of participants sharing their lay expertise, in the form of simplifying assumptions, to cope with the technical details of the GIS-based analysis and move the large group toward agreeing on a transportation package for the region. The article concludes by extending the implications of the research with a three-part framework called participatory interaction modeling, wherein geographically distributed networks of designers and developers, participant users, and social and behavioral science evaluators learn how to create PPGIS capabilities that can better address societal goals.},

  abstract = {Bicycle sharing systems (bike-shares) are becoming increasingly popular in towns and cities around the world. They are viewed as a cheap, efficient, and healthy means of navigating dense urban environments. This paper is the first to take a global view of bike-sharing characteristics by analysing data from 38 systems located in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australasia and the Americas. To achieve this, an extensive database depicting the geographical location and bicycle occupancy of each docking station within a particular system has been created over a number of years to chart the usage in the chosen systems (and others) and provide a consistent basis on which to compare and classify them. Analysis of the variation of occupancy rates over time, and comparison across the system's extent, infers the likely demographics and intentions of user groups. A classification of bike-shares, based on the geographical footprint and diurnal, day-of-week and spatial variations in occupancy rates, is proposed. The knowledge of such patterns and characteristics identifiable from the dataset has a range of applications, including informing operators and policymakers about the maintenance of a suitable balance of bicycles throughout the system area (a nontrivial problem for many bike-shares), the location of new docking stations and cycle lanes, and better targeting of promotional materials to encourage new users. Within the context of transport research, the systems utilised here are part of relatively small, closed environments that can be more easily modelled and validated. Such work lays foundations for the analysis of larger scale transport systems by creating a classification of the different systems and seeks to demonstrate that bike-shares have a lot to offer both as an effective method of transport and a rich source of data. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {In this important new work, Howard T. Odum, widely acknowledged as the father of systems ecology, lucidly explains his concept of emergy, a measure of real wealth that provides a rational, science-based method of evaluating commodities, services, and environmental goods. Using specific real-world examples, Dr. Odum clearly demonstrates the revolutionary role of emergy in environmental management and policy making. Environmental Accounting: Emergy and Environmental Decision Making offers environmental professionals\textendash policymakers, managers, ecologists, planners, developers, and activists\textendash a systematic approach to environmental and economic valuation that will eliminate much of the rancor and adversarial decision making that often plagues environmental issues. Specifically, this book: * Describes the theoretical basis, calculation procedures, and applications of emergy * Introduces the concept of "transformity," the ratio of emergy (work put into a product) and energy (value received from the product) * Provides formulas for emergy calculations, procedures for making an emergy evaluation table, and parameters for updating evaluations * Demonstrates the use of emergy to evaluate environments, minerals, waters, primary energy sources, economic developments, and international trade * Compares the emergy approach to environmental evaluation with others Environmental Accounting: Emergy and Environmental Decision Making will help environmental decision makers and the society they serve maximize economic vitality with less trial and error, innovate with fewer failures, and adapt to change more rapidly. It provides the tools they need to arrive at the best policies in resource management, economics, and the environment. Balancing the economy and the environment\textendash{} from the father of systems ecology Increasing economic dependence on diminishing natural resources has sparked a highly charged debate over the use and fate of the world environment. Environmental Accounting: Emergy and Environmental Decision Making presents a unique method of environmental management based on maximizing real wealth, the whole economy, and the public benefit. Renowned ecologist Howard T. Odum introduces the concept of emergy to provide a rational alternative to the tug-of-war over the world's most vital assets. Emergy measures the energy put into making a product and is the cornerstone of Odum's revolutionary text. This timely and important book offers key insights into: * Determining the real value of a product or service * Transformity, or the relationship between emergy (input) and energy (output) * Stored wealth, available energy, and the final product * Balancing economic and environmental needs Environmental Accounting: Emergy and Environmental Decision Making will help economists, ecologists, policymakers, and planners make more responsible, informed decisions to sustain economic and environmental development.},

The Sentinel-5P is used for mapping the tropospheric NO2 distribution and the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis for evaluating the atmospheric capability to disperse the pollution. The spatial analysis has been conducted on a regional scale and combined with the number of death cases taken from 66 administrative regions in Italy, Spain, France and Germany. Results show that out of the 4443 fatality cases, 3487 (78\%) were in five regions located in north Italy and central Spain. Additionally, the same five regions show the highest NO2 concentrations combined with downwards airflow which prevent an efficient dispersion of air pollution.

Major transport projects may promote or discourage physical activity in the form of walking and cycling, but researching the health effects of such ``natural experiments'' in transport policy or infrastructure is challenging. Methods Case study of attempts in 2004\textendash 2005 to evaluate the effects of two major transport projects in Scotland: an urban congestion charging scheme in Edinburgh, and a new urban motorway (freeway) in Glasgow. Results These interventions are typical of many major transport projects. They are unique to their context. They cannot easily be separated from the other components of the wider policies within which they occur. When, where, and how they are implemented are political decisions over which researchers have no control. Baseline data collection required for longitudinal studies may need to be planned before the intervention is certain to take place. There is no simple way of defining a population or area exposed to the intervention or of defining control groups. Changes in quantitative measures of health-related behavior may be difficult to detect. Conclusions Major transport projects have clear potential to influence population health, but it is difficult to define the interventions, categorize exposure, or measure outcomes in ways that are likely to be seen as credible in the field of public health intervention research. A final study design is proposed in which multiple methods and spatial levels of analysis are combined in a longitudinal quasi-experimental study.},

We sought to examine inequalities in uptake and usage of London's Barclays Cycle Hire (BCH) scheme. Method: We obtained complete BCH registration data, and compared users with the general population. We examined usage levels by explanatory variables including gender, small-area income-deprivation and local cycling prevalence. Results: 100,801 registered individuals made 2.5 million trips between July 2010 and March 2011. Compared with residents and workers in the central London area served by the scheme, registered individuals were more likely to be male and to live in areas of low deprivation and high cycling prevalence. Among those registered, females made 1.63 (95\%CI 1.53, 1.74) fewer trips per month than males, and made under a fifth of all trips. Adjusting for the fact that deprived areas were less likely to be close to BCH docking stations, users in the most deprived areas made 0.85 (95\%CI 0.63,1.07) more trips per month than those in the least deprived areas. Conclusion: Females and residents in deprived areas are underrepresented among users of London's public bicycle sharing scheme. The scheme's planned expansion into more deprived areas has, however, the potential to create a more equitable uptake of cycling. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

  abstract = {Background: Environmental characteristics may be associated with patterns of physical activity in general or with particular types of physical activity such as active travel (walking or cycling for transport). However, most studies in this field have been conducted in North America and Australia, and hypotheses about putative correlates should be tested in a wider range of sociospatial contexts. We therefore examined the contribution of putative personal and environmental correlates of active travel and overall physical activity in deprived urban neighbourhoods in Glasgow, Scotland as part of the baseline for a longitudinal study of the effects of opening a new urban motorway (freeway). Methods: We conducted a postal survey of a random sample of residents (n = 1322), collecting data on socioeconomic status, perceptions of the local environment, travel behaviour, physical activity and general health and wellbeing using a new 14-item neighbourhood rating scale, a travel diary, the short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and the SF-8. We analysed the correlates of active travel and overall physical activity using multivariate logistic regression, first building models using personal (individual and household) explanatory variables and then adding environmental variables. Results: Active travel was associated with being younger, living in owner-occupied accommodation, not having to travel a long distance to work and not having access to a car, whereas overall physical activity was associated with living in social rented accommodation and not being overweight. After adjusting for personal characteristics, neither perceptions of the local environment nor the objective proximity of respondents' homes to motorway or major road infrastructure explained much of the variance in active travel or overall physical activity, although we did identify a significant positive association between active travel and perceived proximity to shops. Conclusion: Apart from access to local amenities, environmental characteristics may have limited influence on active travel in deprived urban populations characterised by a low level of car ownership, in which people may have less capacity for making discretionary travel choices than the populations studied in most published research on the environmental correlates of physical activity.},

Data sources Published and unpublished reports in any language identified from electronic databases, bibliographies, websites, and reference lists. Review methods Systematic search and appraisal to identify experimental or observational studies with a prospective or controlled retrospective design that evaluated any intervention applied to an urban population or area by measuring outcomes in members of the local population. Results 22 studies met the inclusion criteria. We found some evidence that targeted behaviour change programmes can change the behaviour of motivated subgroups, resulting (in the largest study) in a shift of around 5\% of all trips at a population level. Single studies of commuter subsidies and a new railway station also showed positive effects. The balance of best available evidence about publicity campaigns, engineering measures, and other interventions suggests that they have not been effective. Participants in trials of active commuting experienced short term improvements in certain measures of health and fitness, but we found no good evidence on effects on health of any effective intervention at population level. Conclusions The best available evidence of effectiveness in promoting a modal shift is for targeted behaviour change programmes, but the social distribution of their effects is unclear and some other types of intervention have yet to be rigorously evaluated.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to update the evidence on the health benefits of cycling. A systematic review of the literature resulted in 16 cycling-specific studies. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies showed a clear positive relationship between cycling and cardiorespiratory fitness in youths. Prospective observational studies demonstrated a strong inverse relationship between commuter cycling and all-cause mortality, cancer mortality, and cancer morbidity among middle-aged to elderly subjects. Intervention studies among working-age adults indicated consistent improvements in cardiovascular fitness and some improvements in cardiovascular risk factors due to commuting cycling. Six studies showed a consistent positive dose-response gradient between the amount of cycling and the health benefits. Systematic assessment of the quality of the studies showed most of them to be of moderate to high quality. According to standard criteria used primarily for the assessment of clinical studies, the strength of this evidence was strong for fitness benefits, moderate for benefits in cardiovascular risk factors, and inconclusive for all-cause mortality, coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality, cancer risk, and overweight and obesity. While more intervention research is needed to build a solid knowledge base of the health benefits of cycling, the existing evidence reinforces the current efforts to promote cycling as an important contributor for better population health.},

  abstract = {Utilization of movement data from mobile sports tracking applications is affected by its inherent biases and sensitivity, which need to be understood when developing value-added services for, e.g., application users and city planners. We have developed a method for generating a privacy-preserving heat map with user diversity (ppDIV), in which the density of trajectories, as well as the diversity of users, is taken into account, thus preventing the bias effects caused by participation inequality. The method is applied to public cycling workouts and compared with privacy-preserving kernel density estimation (ppKDE) focusing only on the density of the recorded trajectories and privacy-preserving user count calculation (ppUCC), which is similar to the quadrat-count of individual application users. An awareness of privacy was introduced to all methods as a data pre-processing step following the principle of k-Anonymity. Calibration results for our heat maps using bicycle counting data gathered by the city of Helsinki are good (R2 \&gt; 0.7) and raise high expectations for utilizing heat maps in a city planning context. This is further supported by the diurnal distribution of the workouts indicating that, in addition to sports-oriented cyclists, many utilitarian cyclists are tracking their commutes. However, sports tracking data can only enrich official in-situ counts with its high spatio-temporal resolution and coverage, not replace them.},

This paradigm shift demands on new infrastructure that serves and boosts local cycling rates. This creates the need for novel data sources, tools, and methods that allow us to identify and prioritize locations where to intervene via properly planned cycling infrastructure. Here, we define potential demand as the total trips of the population that could be supported by bicycle paths. To that end, we use information from a phone-based travel demand and the trip distance distribution from bike apps. Next, we use percolation theory to prioritize paths with high potential demand that benefit overall connectivity if a bike path would be added. We use Bogot\'a as a case study to demonstrate our methods. The result is a data science framework that informs interventions and improvements to an urban cycling infrastructure.},

We extracted data for the period 2012\textendash 13 (39,585 journey stages) from the Scottish Household Survey. Survey travel diaries recorded all journeys made on the previous day by sampled individuals aged 16 + living within Scotland, and the stages within each journey. Descriptive statistics were calculated for journey stages, mode, purpose and distance. Logistic regression models were fitted to examine the relationship between the likelihood of a journey stage being active, age, sex, area deprivation and urban/rural classification. A quarter of all journey stages were walked or cycled (26\%, n: 10,280/39,585); 96\% of these were walked. Those living in the least deprived areas travelled a greater average distance per active journey stage than those in the most deprived. The likelihood of an active journey stage was higher for those living in the most deprived areas than for those in the least deprived (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.21, 95\% CI 1.04\textendash 1.41) and for those in younger compared to older age groups (OR 0.44, 95\% CI 0.34\textendash 0.58). In conclusion, socio-economic inequalities in active travel were identified, but \textendash{} contrary to the trends for many healthbeneficial behaviours \textendash{} with a greater likelihood of active travel in more deprived areas. This indicates a potential contribution to protecting and improving health for those whose health status tends to be worse. Walking was the most common mode of active travel, and should be promoted as much as cycling.},

"It is concluded that ecological fallacy effects are endemic to areal census data, although their magnitude is perhaps not as large as might have been expected. The principal difficulty is that there is at present no way of predicting in advance the degree of severity likely to be associated with particular variables and particular techniques.

Choice and Integration measures from Space Syntax were used to analyse the street network's configuration for different radiuses. Multiple linear regression models were fitted to explore the influence of these measures on cycling activity at the street segment level after controlling other variables such as land use, household density, socio-economic status, and cycling infrastructure. The variation of such influence for different time periods (weekday vs. weekend) and trip purposes (commuting vs. sports) was also analysed. The results show a positive significant association between normalised angular choice (NACH) and cycling activity. Although the final regression model explained 5.5\% of the log-likelihood of the intercept model, it represents an important improvement compared with the base (control-only) model (3.8\%). The incidence rate ratio of NACH's Z scores was 1.63, implying that for an increase of one standard deviation of NACH, there is an expected increment of about 63\% in the total cyclist counts while keeping all other variables the same. These results are of interest for researchers, practitioners, and urban planners, since the inclusion of Space Syntax measures derived from available public data can improve movement behaviour modelling and cycling infrastructure planning and design.},

  abstract = {THE PERSISTENCE OF THE GERRYMANDER IN NORTH CAROLINA CONGRESSIONAL REDISTRICTING Douglas M. Orr, Jr.* One of the most important special geographic units below the state level is that established for conducting elections. The determination of one type of electoral unit, the congressional district, is a matter of considerable conse\- quence to our federal system of government as manifested in the United States House of Representatives\textemdash ''the grand depository of the democratic principle.'' Yet in our supposedly democratic form of government, congres\- sional districts have traditionally been subject to enormous population disparities and gerrymandering. Political power is rarely surrendered volun\- tarily. A political ``rule of the game'' has been that the party or interest in power apportioned and redistricted so as to stay in power. North Carolina has been no exception. Among its 21 congressional district plans over the past 180 years, including three realignments since 1960, the gerrymander had helped perpetuate the rural domination of the state's congressional delegation, and mor\textsection{} recently, it has been used to try to stem the rising tide of Republicanism and return Democratic incumbents to office. North Carolina therefore provides a meaningful case study as to the persistence of a tactic that has too long prevailed with the nation's political system. GERRYMANDERING. The practice of gerrymandering actually began in Europe, but the term itself originated in 1812 in Massachusetts when Governor Elbridge Gerry carved out an electoral district that was said to resemble a salamander due to its winding shape (Fig. 1). The corruption of the two words gave American politics this descriptive term. This art of political cartography has not been confined to one group or region; both political parties in most parts of the country have practiced it. It represents the manipulation of district boundries in order to juggle district populations for partisan advantage. However, considerable misconception exists con\- cerning the gerrymander. A gerrymandered district may not always be identified by its shape, in spite of the common connotation of the term. The one vote requirement, for example, can be considered an ``anti-gerrymandering '' development because it prevents the inequities of overpopulated and underpopulated districts which were motivated often by party strength in such districts. Yet population equality does not completely prevent gerry\- mandering, although it does restrict partisan maneuvering. The gerrymander may therefore be manifested in several forms, and this art of political abuse has become quite refined by more than a century of *Dr. Orr is assistant professor of geography at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte. The paper was accepted for publication in June 1969. 40 So u t h e a st e r n G e o g r a ph er application in American politics. The several major gerrymandering tech\- niques developed from this experience are summarized as follows: (1) 1. Stacked Districts\textemdash This type of gerrymandered district probably best fits the popular conception of the practice. The ``stacked'' district exhibits the grotesque shape that has inspired the many vivid district descriptions, as it winds its way across the landscape, seeking out pockets of voting strength of one party or interest in an overall area that is predominantly sympathetic to the opposition. Figure 1. The original gerrymander, as depicted in the Boston Gazette of March 26, 1812. The Massachusetts Legislature placed certain towns of Essex County into this odd\- shaped senatorial district in order to concentrate the Federalist vote in as few districts as possible. At firs t described as a salamander, it became known as a gerrymander because Governor Elbridge Gerry signed the redistricting bill into law. Source: Ruth C. Silva, "Reapportionm ent and Redistricting,'' Scientific American, No. 5, November 1965, p. 21. Vol. IX, No. 2 41 2. Excess Votes.\textemdash A popular gerrymandering device is to concentrate the opposition's vote in as few districts as possible so that it is squandered by ``overkill.'' Such planned landslides, also known as ``packed'' districts, insure safe constituencies for a party, but sacrifice votes that might be desperately needed in neighboring districts. Democrats are particularly susceptible to this technique because of the large concentration of traditionally Democratic voters in metropolitan areas. In the South, rural Democrats have ``packed'' districts against urban Democrats. 3. Wasted Votes.\textemdash This...},

Disjoints between theory and empirics may be due to a nonmonotonic relationship between house prices and access to employment arising from the negative externalities associated with proximity to multiple centres of employment. Based on data from Glasgow (Scotland), we use gravity-based measures of accessibility estimated using a flexible functional form that allows for nonmonotonicity. The results are thoroughly tested using recent advances in spatial econometrics. We find compelling evidence of a nonmonotonic effect in the accessibility measure and discuss the implications for planning and housing policy.},

Currently, there are suggested methods for identifying transportation justice areas; however, there is no streamlined method instituted across transportation agencies. Each jurisdiction identifies transportation justice (or environmental justice) areas based on their own methodology, typically based on either average regional thresholds, graduated thresholds, or a more unique in-house index methodology. This research explores and evaluates existing methods and develops a rigorous and comprehensive method called the Transportation Justice Threshold Index Framework (TJTIF) using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), as well as factors based on demographics, socio-economics, and transportation/land use. The framework is applied to a case study region in Pennsylvania reflective of the Marcellus Shale impact area, highlighting Sullivan County, PA. The methodology and the case study application serve as an example for how transportation agencies throughout the country can promote social sustainability and enhance transportation equity.},

Exploring a literature that has tended to polarise 'technical' and 'deliberative' models, we identify a need for sensitive selection and combination of approaches, taking account of both the object and the objective of appraisal in particular contexts. We suggest that an important role for appraisal (by design or by default) may be that of providing spaces for dialogue and learning in the making of policies and decisions. A better understanding of such processes requires further research, particularly well-designed longitudinal work involving retrospective and 'real time' studies of appraisal in practice.},

Planning support systems are available to assist local authorities in developing strategies toward sustainability and resilience of urban areas, but are not always used in practice. We adapted an open-source planning support system to the case of Stockholm County, Sweden, where there is a productive working relationship between researchers, city planners, and regional planners. We employed a collaborative approach in extending and updating the planning support system and analyzed the outcomes, in order to both improve the planning support system and to investigate the process of planner engagement in planning support system development. The approach involved systematic interactions with local planning authorities and e.g. additional data processing, integrating scientific knowledge, policy, and engagement by planners in the complex process of planning for sustainable urban development. This made the planning support system more user-friendly for local planners, facilitating adoption by planning authorities through overcoming common quality and acceptance barriers to the use of planning support system in practice. Involving planners in planning support system development thus increases (i) planning support system quality, producing relevant and up-to-date outputs, and (ii) acceptance for planning support system by regional planners. Further assessment is required to determine whether planners can operate the adapted planning support system unaided.},

These mechanisms have special theoretical importance because disparities in health behaviors, unlike disparities in many other components of health, involve something more than the ability to use income to purchase good health. Based on a review of broad literatures in sociology, economics, and public health, we classify explanations of higher smoking, lower exercise, poorer diet, and excess weight among low-SES persons into nine broad groups that specify related but conceptually distinct mechanisms. The lack of clear support for any one explanation suggests that the literature on SES disparities in health and health behaviors can do more to design studies that better test for the importance of the varied mechanisms.},

Understanding how an intervention works might help explain the effects observed and provide guidance about generalisability. We therefore aimed to review the literature on the effects of this type of intervention and to understand how and why these may or may not be effective. We searched eight electronic databases for existing systematic reviews and mined these for evaluative studies of physical environmental changes and assessed changes in walking, cycling or physical activity. We then searched for related sources including quantitative or qualitative studies, policy documents or reports. We extracted information on the evidence for effects (`estimation'), contexts and mechanisms (`explanation') and assessed credibility, and synthesised material narratively. We identified 13 evaluations of interventions specifically targeting walking and cycling and used 46 related sources. 70\% (n = 9 evaluations) scored 3 or less on the credibility criteria for effectiveness. 6 reported significant positive effects, but higher quality evaluations were more likely to report positive effects. Only two studies provided rich evidence of mechanisms. We identified three common resources that interventions provide to promote walking and cycling: (i) improving accessibility and connectivity; (ii) improving traffic and personal safety; and (iii) improving the experience of walking and cycling. The most effective interventions appeared to target accessibility and safety in both supportive and unsupportive contexts. Although the evidence base was relatively limited, we were able to understand the role of context in the success of interventions. Researchers and policy makers should consider the context and mechanisms which might operate before evaluating and implementing interventions.},

  abstract = {The availability of geo-spatial mobility data (e.g., GPS traces, call detail records) is a trend that will grow in the near future. For this reason, understanding and simulating human mobility is of paramount importance for many present and future applications, such as traffic forecasting, urban planning, and epidemic modeling, and hence for many actors, from urban planners to decision-makers and advertising companies. scikit-mobility is a Python library for mobility analysis and simulation that allows the user to: (1) analyze mobility data by using the main measures characterizing human mobility patterns (e.g., radius of gyration, daily motifs, mobility entropy); (2) simulate individual and collective mobility by executing the most common human mobility models (e.g., gravity and radiation models, exploration and preferential return model); (3) compare all these models by a set of validation metrics taken from the literature. scikit-mobility provides an efficient and easy-to-use implementation, based on the standard Python library numpy, pandas and geopandas, of the main collective and individual human mobility models existing in literature, allowing for both the fitting of the parameters from real data and the running of the models for the generation of synthetic spatio-temporal trajectories. scikit-mobility is a starting point for the development of urban simulation and what-if analysis, e.g., simulating changes in urban mobility after the construction of a new infrastructure or when traumatic events occur like epidemic diffusion, terrorist attacks or international events.},

Two models of perceived risk, based on non-linear least squares, and a model of acceptability, based on the logit model, have been estimated for whole journeys based on responses from a sample of 144 commuters to video clips of routes and junctions. The risk models quantify the effect of motor traffic volumes, demonstrate that roundabouts add more to perceived risk than traffic signal controlled junctions and show that right turn manoeuvres increase perceived risk. Facilities for bicycle traffic along motor trafficked routes and at junctions are shown to have little effect on perceived risk and this brings into question the value of such facilities in promoting bicycle use. These models would assist in specifying infrastructure improvements, the recommending of least risk advisory routes and assessing accessibility for bicycle traffic. The acceptability model confirms the effect of reduced perceived risk in traffic free conditions and the effects of signal controlled junctions and right turns. The acceptability models, which may be used at an area wide level, would assist in assessing the potential demand for cycling and in target setting.},

It needs to be highly efficient given the increasing detail of OSM data and the need to apply it to large extent regions. In this article, a comparison between the implementation of OSM2LULC in different available GIS platforms is made using both vector and raster data structures, which resulted in different versions. A description of the differences of each version is made and, to assess their performance, they were applied to four different study areas with different characteristics, in terms of available OSM data and area size. The performance of each version was evaluated taking into account: the overall processing time required to obtain LULC maps; and differences in the results obtained when different data structures (vector and raster) were used. Results showed that the adoption of a strategy that favors interoperability between FOSS4G and the combined use of both vector and raster data promotes a performance increase. After analysing the topological relationships of OSM data, the conversion to raster data format and the execution of procedural parts with such data indicated significant performance gains, without any positional distortions that significantly compromise the applicability of the final result in further case scenarios.},

Of course, development of an app is only the first challenge associated with using such tools; information also needs to be inferred from collected data. The Itinerum platform was created to overcome the barriers facing the use of smartphones for transportation research. The Itinerum platform is a smartphone travel survey platform that allows researchers to customize the Itinerum app with their own questions and prompts, distribute these surveys, monitor, visualize and increasingly process collected data without a background in programming. With the platform, a customized study can be created in 10~min.},

Researchers in the biologic and physical sciences expect results to be replicated by independent data, analytical methods, laboratories, and instruments. Epidemiologic studies are commonly used to quantify small health effects of important, but subtle, risk factors, and replication is of critical importance where results can inform substantial policy decisions. However, because of the time, expense, and opportunism of many current epidemiologic studies, it is often impossible to fully replicate their findings. An attainable minimum standard is "reproducibility," which calls for data sets and software to be made available for verifying published findings and conducting alternative analyses. The authors outline a standard for reproducibility and evaluate the reproducibility of current epidemiologic research. They also propose methods for reproducible research and implement them by use of a case study in air pollution and health.},

These studies have generally adopted a common approach to define environmental exposures, focusing on the local residential environment, using census tracts or postcodes to delimit exposures. However, use of such administrative units may not be appropriate to evaluate contextual effets on health because they are generally not a 'true' representation of the environments to which individuals are exposed. Recent work has suggested that advances may be made if an activity-space approach is adopted. The present paper investigates how various disciplines may contribute to the refinement of the concept of activity space for use in health research. In particular we draw on seminal work in time geography, which provides a framework to describe individual behavior in space and time, and can help the conceptualization of activity space. In addition we review work in environmental psychology and social networks research, which provides insights on how people and places interact and offers new theories for improving the spatial definition of contextual exposures. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Over the past decades, transport researchers and policy-makers have devoted increasing attention to questions about justice and equity. Nonetheless, there is still little engagement with theories in political philosophy to frame what justice means in the context of transport policies. This paper reviews key theories of justice (utilitarianism, libertarianism, intuitionism, Rawls' egalitarianism, and Capability Approaches (CAs)) and critically evaluates the insights they generate when applied to transport. Based on a combination of Rawlsian and CAs, we propose that distributive justice concerns over transport disadvantage and social exclusion should focus primarily on accessibility as a human capability. This means that, in policy evaluation, a detailed analysis of the distributional effects of transport policies should take account of the setting of minimum standards of accessibility to key destinations and the extent to which these policies respect individuals' rights and prioritise disadvantaged groups, reduce inequalities of opportunities, and mitigate transport externalities. A full account of justice in transportation requires a more complete understanding of accessibility than traditional approaches have been able to deliver to date.},

A comparison is made of two concepts central to transport infrastructure planning in Sweden; Regional expansion and Environmentally sound transport. These concepts signify different perspectives on the benefits and problems with transport. The analysis explains how these clashing perspectives are resolved in the planning process. A discourse theoretical framework is applied to analyse the interplay between the concepts, the framings of problems and solutions, knowledge production practices and the outcomes of the planning process. The main finding is that the growth paradigm, captured in the concept of Regional expansion, has a strong influence on the planning discourse and restricts environmental policy options. The existing planning practices are mainly supporting the growth paradigm and contribute to an emphasis on certain problems and issues e.g. lack of capacity in the transport system and commuting trips. This results in other possible options e.g. reducing road transport volumes, or addressing leisure and service related travel, being excluded from the planning discourse. A number of consequences for the outcome of the planning process are discussed and possible ways of reframing problems are suggested.},

AURIN provides direct access to more than 4000 data sets, over 100 spatial analysis tools and powerful computational resources that are typically available in desktop GIS. The experience of developing, communicating and using AURIN has provided insights into the opportunities unleashed by new models of GIS research.

Specifically, SP3 includes not just the ability to utilize the explicit geography of geolocated tweets but also analyze implicit geography by recognizing and geolocating references in both tweet text, which indicates locations tweeted about, and in Twitter profiles, which indicates locations affiliated with users. Key features of SP3 reported here include flexible search and filtering capabilities to support information foraging; an ingest, processing, and indexing pipeline that produces near real-time access for big streaming data; and a novel strategy for implementing a web-based multi-view visual interface with dynamic linking of entities across views. The SP3 system architecture was designed to support crisis management applications, but its design flexibility makes it easily adaptable to other domains. We also report on a user study that provided input to SP3 interface design and suggests next steps for effective spatiotemporal analytics using social media sources.},

They have moved from spatial interaction models or statistical models through econometric models to micro-simulation, cell-based automata and agent-based models. There has been a move towards more detail in representing space and individual behaviour. This paper presents an alternative approach which uses an intentionally developed strategic high-level model. Nevertheless this model still delivers comparable levels of statistical fit in terms of validation but is easy to present to decision makers and planners. The paper introduces the concepts behind the MARS model, deals with validation and transferability between cities and provides example applications.

  abstract = {Different types of spatial knowledge (expert, sectoral, tacit and community) are strategic resources in urban planning and management. Participatory spatial knowledge management is a major method for eliciting various types of knowledge, providing a platform for knowledge integration and informing local action and public policy. Knowledge types linked to a specific geographical locality can be integrated through geographical information systems. Recent developments in geographical information and communication technology (geoICT) have extended the opportunities for participatory spatial knowledge production, use and exchange. However, data reliability of user-generated content, social exclusion due to dependence on technology and the interpretation and implications of digital maps are major concerns. The challenge is how to integrate and utilize multiple knowledge sources for improving urban management and governance. This paper integrates the literature on knowledge types and knowledge production processes with available geoICT tools for the production, use and exchange of knowledge sources and applies it to examples from Asia, Africa and Latin America. From this review, we provide a heuristic framework for assessing the extent to which participatory spatial knowledge management tools can be instrumental on several fronts. We argue that technological developments of knowledge production have not fully addressed important issues related to accountability, empowerment, control and use of knowledge. Moreover, these developments may foster social exclusion, which could detract from the benefits of participatory spatial knowledge management in the context of urban sustainability.},

Methods: Following consultation with experts from a variety of fields and a literature search, we developed a Systematic Pedestrian and Cycling Environmental Scan (SPACES) instrument and used it to collect data over a total of 1987 kilometers of roads in metropolitan Perth, Western Australia. The audit instrument is available from the first author on request. Additional environmental information was collected using desktop methods and geographic information systems (GIS) technology. We assessed inter- and intra-rater reliability of the instrument among the 16 observers who collected the data. Results: The observers reported that the audit instrument was easy to use. Both inter- and intra-rater reliability of the environmental scan instrument were generally high. Conclusions: Our instrument provides a reliable, practical, and easy-to-use method for collecting detailed ``street-level'' data on physical environmental factors that are potential influences on walking in local neighborhoods.},

These comparisons always aim at measuring the accuracy with which the models reproduce the mobility described by origin-destination matrices. This has been done at different spatial scales using different datasets, and several versions of the models have been proposed to adjust to various spatial systems. However the models, to our knowledge, have never been compared with respect to policy testing scenarios. For this reason, here we use the models to analyze the impact of the introduction of a new transportation network, a Bus Rapid Transport system, in the city of Teresina in Brazil. We do this by measuring the estimated variation in the trip distribution, and formulate an accessibility to employment indicator for the different zones of the city. By comparing the results obtained with the two approaches, we are able, not only to better assess the goodness of fit and the impact of this intervention, but also to understand reasons for the systematic similarities and differences in their predictions.},

  abstract = {Objective: Promoting cycling has moved up the policy agenda in recent years, but debate still exists surrounding the role played by socioeconomic barriers to participation in low cycling countries. This ecological study aimed to examine whether there are systematic socioeconomic disparities in access to cycling infrastructure and investment in Melbourne, Australia. Methods: We used Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques to measure the density of on-road, off-road and informal cycling routes in 58 neighbourhoods of inner Melbourne. We examined whether small-area socioeconomic indicators were associated with the density of these three types of cycling infrastructure or with local government spending on cycling. We additionally examined how small-area socioeconomic position and infrastructure density were associated with the prevalence of cycling to work in the 2011 census. Results: The density of on- and off-road cycling infrastructure was positively associated with cycle modal share (both p o0.0001), and there was no evidence that the strength of this association differed between the two infrastructure types. The density of informal routes was not associated with cycling to work. There was no evidence that small-area socioeconomic position was systematically associated with the presence of on-road or quiet roads cycling infrastructure or with levels of investment. Levels of off-road infrastructure were somewhat higher in richer areas (r {$\frac{1}{4}$}0.32, p{$\frac{1}{4}$}0.02), although much of this was located in parkland and may have a predominant recreational function. Conclusion: In Melbourne, cycling infrastructure is positively correlated with cycle prevalence and is generally distributed equitably with respect to area-level socioeconomic position. In part this reflects the high levels of cycling infrastructure and spending in some relatively disadvantaged areas. Further studies that seek to understand the drivers behind successful policies in these areas may provide lessons for other areas, and aid our understanding of the complex relationships between cycling infrastructure, cycling behaviour and socioeconomic position.},

The availability of Internet-based options for implementing PPGIS presents new opportunities for increased efficiency and new modes of access.

We compared participant characteristics, mapping participation, and the spatial distribution of mapped attributes between participants who responded to the paper versus Internet option. The response rate for those who completed the paper version of the survey was nearly 2.5 times the response rate of the Internet version. Paper participants also mapped significantly more places than did Internet participants (43 vs. 18). Internet participants tended to be younger, more likely to have a college degree, and had lived in the region for less time than paper participants. For all but one attribute there was no difference in the spatial distribution of places mapped between Internet and paper methods. Using a paper-based PPGIS survey resulted in a higher response rate, reduced participant bias, and greater mapping participation. However, survey mode did not influence the spatial distribution of the PPGIS data.},

If correct, this implies substantial variations in the size of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS). However, most climate and ice sheet models have not been able to simulate significant EAIS retreat from continental size, given that atmospheric CO2 levels were relatively low throughout this period. Here, we use a continental ice sheet model to show that mechanisms based on recent observations and analysis have the potential to resolve this model\textendash data conflict. In response to atmospheric and ocean temperatures typical of past warm periods, floating ice shelves may be drastically reduced or removed completely by increased oceanic melting, and by hydrofracturing due to surface melt draining into crevasses. Ice at deep grounding lines may be weakened by hydrofracturing and reduced buttressing, and may fail structurally if stresses exceed the ice yield strength, producing rapid retreat. Incorporating these mechanisms in our ice-sheet model accelerates the expected collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to decadal time scales, and also causes retreat into major East Antarctic subglacial basins, producing {$\sim$}17 m global sea-level rise within a few thousand years. The mechanisms are highly parameterized and should be tested by further process studies. But if accurate, they offer one explanation for past sea-level high stands, and suggest that Antarctica may be more vulnerable to warm climates than in most previous studies.},

  abstract = {Whilst there is an increasing capability to instrument smart cities using fixed and mobile sensors to produce the big data to better understand and manage transportation use, there still exists a wide gap between the sustainability goals of smart cities, e.g., to promote less private car use at peak times, with respect to their ability to more dynamically support individualised shifts in multi-modal transportation use to help achieve such goals. We describe the development of the tripzoom system developed as part of the SUNSET-SUstainable social Network SErvices for Transport-project to research and develop a mobile and fixed traffic sensor system to help facilitate individual mobility shifts. Its main novelty was its ability to use mobile sensors to classify common multiple urban transportation modes, to generate information-rich individual and group mobility profiles and to couple this with the use of a targeted incentivised marketplace to gamify travel. This helps to promote mobility shifts towards achieving sustainability goals. This system was trialled in three European country cities operated as Living Labs over six months. Our main findings were that we were able to accomplish a level of behavioural shifts in travel behaviour. Hence, we have provided a proof-of-concept system that uses positive incentives to change individual travel behaviour.},

This model uses several tools to simulate the activity patterns, including a new method to extract activity patterns from data and decision trees to take into account personal and household characteristics. The model outputs are the individuals' daily activity patterns on a detailed temporal scale. These patterns respect individuals' constraints, which are implicitly embedded in the simulated activity and travel schedules via the intrahousehold interactions.

Insights into mechanisms of interventions can help strengthen causal attribution and improve understanding of divergent response patterns. We examined the causal pathways linking exposure to new transport infrastructure with changes in cycling to work. Methods We used baseline (2009) and follow-up (2012) data (N = 469) from the Commuting and Health in Cambridge natural experimental study (Cambridge, UK). Exposure to new infrastructure in the form of the Cambridgeshire Guided Busway was defined using residential proximity. Mediators studied were changes in perceptions of the route to work, theory of planned behaviour constructs and self-reported use of the new infrastructure. Outcomes were modelled as an increase, decrease or no change in weekly cycle commuting time. We used regression analyses to identify combinations of mediators forming potential pathways between exposure and outcome. We then tested these pathways in a path model and stratified analyses by baseline level of active commuting. Results We identified changes in perceptions of the route to work, and use of the cycle path, as potential mediators. Of these potential mediators, only use of the path significantly explained (85\%) the effect of the infrastructure in increasing cycling. Path use also explained a decrease in cycling among more active commuters. Conclusion The findings strengthen the causal argument that changing the environment led to changes in health-related behaviour via use of the new infrastructure, but also show how some commuters may have spent less time cycling as a result.},

We studied the effects of the new M74 motorway (freeway) - opened in 2011 - and the existing M8 motorway in Glasgow, Scotland, on physical activity and sedentary behaviour among local residents. METHODS: This natural experimental study used baseline (T1; 2005) and follow-up data (T2; 2013) from a longitudinal cohort (N~=~365) and two cross-sectional samples (T1~N~=~980; T2~N~=~978). Adult participants were recruited from three study areas: one surrounding the new motorway, one surrounding the existing motorway, and a third, control, area without a motorway. The outcomes were self-reported time spent sitting, walking, and in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Motorway exposure was defined in terms of (1) study area and (2) distance from home to the nearest motorway junction. Outcomes were regressed on exposures in two-part (walking and MVPA) or linear (sedentary behaviour) cohort and repeat cross-sectional models, adjusted for baseline behaviour and sociodemographic covariates. RESULTS: Cohort participants living in the M8 area were less likely to participate in MVPA at follow-up than those living in the area without a motorway (OR 0.37; 95\%CI 0.15, 0.91). Within the M8 area, those living closer to the motorway were also less likely to do so (OR 0.30; 95\%CI 0.09, 0.97). No other statistically significant results were found. CONCLUSIONS: We found some evidence of a negative association between exposure to an existing urban motorway and MVPA. However, the behavioural impacts of motorways are likely to be complex and evolve over time.},

  abstract = {Background Increases in physical activity through active travel have the potential to have large beneficial effects on populations, through both better health outcomes and reduced motorized traffic. However accurately identifying travel mode in large datasets is problematic. Here we provide an open source tool to quantify time spent stationary and in four travel modes(walking, cycling, train, motorised vehicle) from accelerometer measured physical activity data, combined with GPS and GIS data. Methods The Examining Neighbourhood Activities in Built Living Environments in London study evaluates the effect of the built environment on health behaviours, including physical activity. Participants wore accelerometers and GPS receivers on the hip for 7 days. We time-matched accelerometer and GPS, and then extracted data from the commutes of 326 adult participants, using stated commute times and modes, which were manually checked to confirm stated travel mode. This yielded examples of five travel modes: walking, cycling, motorised vehicle, train and stationary. We used this example data to train a gradient boosted tree, a form of supervised machine learning algorithm, on each data point (131,537 points), rather than on journeys. Accuracy during training was assessed using five-fold cross-validation. We also manually identified the travel behaviour of both 21 participants from ENABLE London (402,749 points), and 10 participants from a separate study (STAMP-2, 210,936 points), who were not included in the training data. We compared our predictions against this manual identification to further test accuracy and test generalisability. Results Applying the algorithm, we correctly identified travel mode 97.3\% of the time in cross-validation (mean sensitivity 96.3\%, mean active travel sensitivity 94.6\%). We showed 96.0\% agreement between manual identification and prediction of 21 individuals' travel modes (mean sensitivity 92.3\%, mean active travel sensitivity 84.9\%) and 96.5\% agreement between the STAMP-2 study and predictions (mean sensitivity 85.5\%, mean active travel sensitivity 78.9\%). Conclusion We present a generalizable tool that identifies time spent stationary and time spent walking with very high precision, time spent in trains or vehicles with good precision, and time spent cycling with moderate precisionIn studies where both accelerometer and GPS data are available this tool complements analyses of physical activity, showing whether differences in PA may be explained by differences in travel mode.

In this paper, we provide an exploratory overview of relations in OSM for four European cities. In this exploration, we undertake analysis of relations to assess their complexity, composition and flexibility within the OSM data model. We show that some of the patterns discovered by researchers related to OSM nodes and ways also exist in relations. We find some other interesting aspects of relations which we believe can act as a catalyst for a more sustained future research effort on relations in OSM. These aspects include: the potential influence of bulk imports of geographical data to OSM, tagging of relations, and contribution patterns of edits to OSM relations.},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, the number of bicycle trips in the United States has doubled. Since 48\% of trips by all modes in American cities are shorter than three miles, the potential for further growth in bicycling seems enormous. So far, eorts to promote bicycling have focused on building bike paths and bike lanes. Although necessary, separate cycling facilities must be complemented by a comprehensive program to make all roads bikeable, through both physical adaptations and enforcement of cyclists' right to use the road. It seems likely that cycling will continue to grow in North America, but that its mode share will remain far lower than levels in northern Europe. Bicycling in Canada and especially the United States is impeded by the lack of a tradition of cycling for utilitarian purposes and by the marginal legal, cultural and infrastructure status of cyclists in both countries' automobile-based transport systems. As long as car use remains cheap and transportation policy remains dominated by motoring, bicycles will continue to be used primarily for recreation and not for daily urban travel in North America. \'O 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We analyze aggregate data for the two countries as well as cityspecific case study data for nine large cities (Chicago, Minneapolis, Montr\'eal, New York, Portland, San Francisco, Toronto, Vancouver, and Washington). Cycling levels have increased in both the USA and Canada, while cyclist fatalities have fallen. There is much spatial variation and socioeconomic inequality in cycling rates. The bike share of work commuters is more than twice as high in Canada as in the USA, and is higher in the western parts of both countries. Cycling is concentrated in central cities, especially near universities and in gentrified neighborhoods near the city center. Almost all the growth in cycling in the USA has been among men between 25\textendash 64 years old, while cycling rates have remained steady among women and fallen sharply for children. Cycling rates have risen much faster in the nine case study cities than in their countries as a whole, at least doubling in all the cities since 1990. They have implemented a wide range of infrastructure and programs to promote cycling and increase cycling safety: expanded and improved bike lanes and paths, traffic calming, parking, bike-transit integration, bike sharing, training programs, and promotional events. We describe the specific accomplishments of the nine case study cities, focusing on each city's innovations and lessons for other cities trying to increase cycling. Portland's comprehensive package of cycling policies has succeeded in raising cycling levels 6-fold and provides an example that other North American cities can follow.},

  abstract = {A review of the literature suggests that current guidelines for road lighting lack a clear empirical basis. Where there is evidence, this tends to be based on motorists or pedestrians: there is little, if any, consideration given to the needs of cyclists. This thesis presents an investigation of lighting for cycling after dark within an urban environment.  Three empirical investigations were conducted. A field survey was conducted to investigate the influence of the ambient light level on the tendency to cycle. Mobile eye-tracking was used to investigate the gaze behaviour of cyclists in natural settings, using two parallel measurements to reveal the critical of these fixations: performance on an audio dual-task and skin conductance response (SCR), and by that improved the ecological validity of previous similar research. A laboratory experiment was conducted to investigate obstacle detection under variations in the type, location, and level of lighting.  The field study revealed that cycling increases when the ambient light level is higher. This suggests that road lighting might be a tool to encourage more cycling. The eye-tracking study suggested that observing the path ahead is a critical task, reflecting a tendency to search for possible obstacles on the road. Post hoc analysis of the eye-tracking data also suggested an influence of ambient light level on gaze towards aesthetic elements (architectural features) of the environment with such elements are suggested by the literature to be associated with positive cycling experience: this suggests that appropriate road lighting motivates the choice to cycle.  The detection experiment revealed two significant effects: first; that road lighting and bicycle lighting may conflict. In other words, using bicycle lighting on a lit road may impair detection performance, not improve it. Second; that detection is improved when the front bicycle lamp is located on the wheel hub rather than the handlebar.},

  abstract = {Since the introduction of motor vehicles, practicing engineers and city planner have underestimated the potential of non-motorized transport. As traffic congestion has become severe in many large cities, especially in the developing world, other transport alternatives need to be considered and efficient public transport systems should be given utter priority as they have enormous environmental, social and commercial benefits. There are several options of public transport system. However, in recent times the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system option is fast catching up with developing countries. Accra has in recent years been grappling to put in place a public transport system. The BRT concept has been introduced and the World Bank has pledged to support it having ascertained its feasibility [1,2]. Inevitably, there has arisen the need to integrate cycling into the BRT system owing to the increasing use of bicycles in Accra. The integration will afford commuters the opportunity to combined different modes in the most efficient, time and cost-effective manner. This would therefore require strategic planning to link cycle routes to terminals on major route.},

  abstract = {There is a growing awareness that significant benefits for our health and environment could be achieved by reducing our use of cars and shifting instead to active transport, i.e. walking and bicycling. The present article presents an estimate of the health impacts due to a shift from car to bicycling or walking, by evaluating four effects: the change in exposure to ambient air pollution for the individuals who change their transportation mode, their health benefit, the health benefit for the general population due to reduced pollution and the risk of accidents. We consider only mortality in detail, but at the end of the paper we also cite costs for other impacts, especially noise and congestion. For the dispersion of air pollution from cars we use results of the Transport phase of the ExternE project series and derive general results that can be applied in different regions. We calculate the health benefits of bicycling and walking based on the most recent review by the World Health Organization. For a driver who switches to bicycling for a commute of 5 km (one way) 5 days/week 46 weeks/yr the health benefit from the physical activity is worth about 1300 \texteuro/yr, and in a large city (\&gt;500,000) the value of the associated reduction of air pollution is on the order of 30 \texteuro/yr. For the individual who makes the switch, the change in air pollution exposure and dose implies a loss of about 20 \texteuro/yr under our standard scenario but that is highly variable with details of the trajectories and could even have the opposite sign. The results for walking are similar. The increased accident risk for bicyclists is extremely dependent on the local context; data for Paris and Amsterdam imply that the loss due to fatal accidents is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the health benefit of the physical activity. An analysis of the uncertainties shows that the general conclusion about the order of magnitude of these effects is robust. The results can be used for cost-benefit analysis of programs or projects to increase active transport, provided one can estimate the number of individuals who make a mode shift.},

In this viewpoint, we explore an understudied pathway between household income and health: automobile dependence. We argue that the provision of policies that reduce automobile dependence, and facilitate active and affordable modes of travel (i.e. walking, cycling and public transport), may mitigate poorer health among individuals from lower-income households. Policies and environments that support active travel are likely to have particularly strong health and economic benefits for lower-income residents.},

But where is it most expedient to invest into new infrastructure or initiatives? This work seeks to shed light on the question and therefore presents a new supporting methodology for planners and decision-makers that builds upon body-energy consumption and relies on Austrian census commuter data. The main challenges and scientific contributions lie in the proposal of a new raster-based GIS model to calculate the energetic demand between and inside of Austrian municipalities, overcoming limitations of previous approaches. A regression analysis is conducted in order to check for a statistical relationship between cycle-share and body energy expenditure. This further allows the calculation of a potential value for investments as the deviation between the energetically predicted cycle-share and the present cycling level. Topography and routing distance are reported to explain between 53 and 63 percent of intra- and interzonal bicycle shares. It is therefore concluded that body energy consumption has a major impact on cycling. The work ends with the discussion of results and provides a perspective on the usage of this evidence-based methodology in national and international planning and research. Additionally, a discussion of the results in the context of the simultaneously developed British Propensity to Cycle Tool is provided.},

The need for pedestrian flow data as part of pedestrian exposure and safety analysis is outlined, and the background of each type of model is discussed. It then selects the space syntax network analysis model to estimate pedestrian volumes for the city of Boston, Massachusetts. It was found that the model was able to accurately predict pedestrian flows (r-squared 0.81, p-value \&lt; 0.0001) after incorporating distance to transit stops and major tourist attractions. These findings suggest that in addition to estimating pedestrian volumes in geographic locations where data is not available, pedestrian volume modeling can also be useful for estimating pedestrian volumes in future conditions. Planning and policy implications are discussed, as are directions for future research.},

The air sample charcoal tubes were analysed for their benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene \v{Z}BTEX. content and the air filters for particles \v{Z}total dust.. The concentrations of particles and BTEX in the cabin of the cars were 2᎐4 times greater than in the cyclists' breathing zone, the greatest difference being for BTEX.

On the one hand, Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) with a high degree of sophistication have replaced line-driven commands of first-generation GIS. On the other hand, a number of alternative approaches have been suggested, most notably those based on Virtual Environments (VEs). In this paper we discuss a novel interface for GIS, which springs from recent work carried out in the field of Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs). The philosophy behind TUIs is to allow people to interact with computers via familiar tangible objects, therefore taking advantage of the richness of the tactile world combined with the power of numerical simulations. Two experimental systems, named Illuminating Clay and SandScape, are described here and their applications to GIS are examined. Conclusions suggest that these interfaces might streamline the landscape design process and result in a more effective use of GIS, especially when distributed decision-making and discussion with non-experts are involved.},

  abstract = {The Dutch concept of `bicycle highways' is increasingly being adopted by urban planners owing to rising environmental and health consciousness, and the growing popularity of electric bicycles. Bicycle highways differ from other types of cycling infrastructure in that they avoid intersections with motorised traffic, and are wide enough to allow for safe overtaking, thereby increasing cycling speeds. While many studies investigate the feasibility of constructing bicycle highways, few explore their effect on users' travel preferences. In this context, our study aims to assess the potential impact of bicycle highways on commuter mode choice. We built a discrete choice model based on individual commute data from a national household travel survey, Mobilit\"at in Deutschland 2008. The model was estimated in a logit modelling framework using Biogeme. We estimated multinomial logit and nested logit models and found nested logit to be more appropriate. The model estimates were then applied to forecast mode shares in scenarios with the pilot bicycle highway proposed in the Munich region. The variation in mode shares across scenarios with increasing average cycling speeds was analysed in areas with varying proximity to the infrastructure. The results suggest that bicycle highways reduce motorised travel and increase cycling. The effect is stronger as proximity to the corridor increases. The analysis helps to quantify the potential impact of bicycle highways on commuter mode choice even without considering further benefits beyond travel time reductions, such as increased safety, convenience, comfort, and reduced risks due to fewer interactions with motorised traffic.},

Not only an anarchist, but also a radical feminist, antiracist, ecologist, animal rights advocate, cultural radical, nudist, and vegetarian, Reclus' ideas are presented both through detailed exposition and analysis and in extensive translations of key texts, most appearing in English for the first time. The work elucidates Reclus' greatest achievement, a sweeping historical and theoretical synthesis recounting the story of the earth and humanity as an epochal struggle between freedom and domination, and his crucial insights on the interrelation between personal and small-group transformation, broader cultural change, and large-scale social organization are also explored.},

  abstract = {Background: Physical inactivity plays a role in the acquisition of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and breast and colon cancer. The impact of such noncommunicable diseases on low- and middle-income countries is a major global health concern, but most studies in this area have focused on high-income countries. A better understanding of the factors that may influence physical activity in low- and middle-income countries is needed. Purpose: This study describes the prevalence of cycling and walking for transportation and their association with personal and environmental factors in adults from three state capitals in Brazil. Methods: In 2007-2009, a random-digit-dialing telephone survey was conducted with residents (aged {$\geq$}18 years) of Curitiba, Vitoria, and Recife, sampled through a clustered multistage sampling process. Walking and cycling for transportation, perception of the environment related to physical activity, and demographic and health characteristics were collected. Poisson regression was used to examine associations between cycling and walking for transportation with covariates stratified by cities. All analyses were conducted in 2011. Results: The prevalence of bicycling for transportation was 13.4\%; higher in Recife (16.0\%; 95\% CI=13.7, 18.4) compared to Curitiba (9.6\%; 95\% CI=7.8, 11.4) and Vitoria (8.8\%; 95\% CI=7.34, 10.1); and 26.6\% for walking regularly as a mode of transportation. The adjusted analysis showed that cycling is positively associated with being male (prevalence OR [pOR]=3.4; 95\% CI=2.6, 18.4) and younger (pOR=2.9; 95\% CI=1.8, 4.9) and inversely associated with having a college degree (pOR=0.3; 95\% CI=0.2, 0.4). Walking for transportation is inversely associated with having a college degree (pOR=0.6; 95\% CI=0.5, 0.8). No strong evidence of association was found of environmental indicators with walking or bicycling. Conclusions: The prevalence of active commuting was low and varied by city. Personal factors were more consistently associated with bicycling than with walking, whereas perceived environmental features were not related to active commuting. \textcopyright{} 2013 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

The efficiency of this approach, like other information-based schemes, can benefit from the knowledge of which groups of individuals are more responsive to these types of interventions. The goal of this study is to examine the level of acceptability of persuasive schemes delivered using smartphone applications across different population segments. A cross-sectional survey was applied to 920 university students in Curitiba, a roughly 2-million inhabitant Brazilian city. The questionnaire was developed considering two groups of indicators: individual determinants of travel behavior, which were extracted from theories of social psychology (i.e. the Theory of Planned Behavior, the Norm-Activation Model and others), as well as stated intentions and attitudes toward a range of eleven different persuasive strategies (money or voucher rewards, points and rankings, social media sharing, etc.). Groups with different psychographic profiles were extracted from the sample using cluster and discriminant analyses. The acceptability of persuasive strategies were compared between segments. Results show a higher individual preference toward financial rewards and a relatively lower acceptability of social media tools. The acceptance level of groups that display higher control over the use of non-motorized forms of transport is higher than groups that are more psychologically predisposed to CFVs.},

Additionally, citizens can help scientists better understand and address issues of concern to their families and communities. However, citizen science also raises ethical issues that should be addressed when projects begin and throughout the course of scientific investigation. To promote ethical research, scientists should develop guidelines for involvement of citizens in research, communicate effectively with participants and local communities at the outset of their involvement in research projects, carefully oversee their work, develop appropriate publication practices, and provide lay-volunteers with education and training on the responsible conduct of research. Researchers also need to be cognizant of clarifying these roles and responsibilities as well as promoting appropriate and safe citizen participation and transparency of the study methods, data analysis, and communication of results.

It has its origins in the United Kingdom of the early 2000s, but the diversity of theoretical perspectives, research methods and practical focus shown by the contributions to the present issue on this theme bears witness to the evolution and translation this concept and term has undergone over more than a decade. Nine papers are presented, concerning applications of the concept in three continents, and including some of the poorest and richest per capita income countries on the globe. As well as developing and applying the multi-faceted theories of the processes of exclusion and techniques for the quantitative identification of inclusion, they consider important topics such as the treatment of the less abled and more frail members of society when on the move and the potential for new technological design methods and practical solutions either to enhance inclusion or deepen inequality in our societies. Collectively their conclusions reinforce the message that social exclusion remains multi-dimensional, relational and dynamic, located both in the circumstances of the excluded individual as well as in the processes, institutions and structures that permeate wider society.},

Conceptualising Demand focuses on five core propositions: that demand is derived from social practices; that it is made and not simply met; that it is materially embedded and temporally unfolding; and that it is modulated through many forms of policy and governance. In working through these claims, the book weaves concepts from the sociology of consumption, science and technology studies, policy analyses and social theories of practice together with empirical cases and new research into such topics as the rise of refrigerated foods, the emergence of online shopping and the transformation of energy demanding services.  This innovative book takes a fresh look at the very idea of demand, a concept that is often taken for granted, but that is vital for scholars and students of~energy, mobility, climate change and consumption, and anyone interested in the subject.},

  abstract = {Computational techniques based on simulation have now become an essential part of the statistician's toolbox. It is thus crucial to provide statisticians with a practical understanding of those methods, and there is no better way to develop intuition and skills for simulation than to use simulation to solve statistical problems. Introducing Monte Carlo Methods with R covers the main tools used in statistical simulation from a programmer's point of view, explaining the R implementation of each simulation technique and providing the output for better understanding and comparison. While this book constitutes a comprehensive treatment of simulation methods, the theoretical justification of those methods has been considerably reduced, compared with Robert and Casella (2004). Similarly, the more exploratory and less stable solutions are not covered here. This book does not require a preliminary exposure to the R programming language or to Monte Carlo methods, nor an advanced mathematical background. While many examples are set within a Bayesian framework, advanced expertise in Bayesian statistics is not required. The book covers basic random generation algorithms, Monte Carlo techniques for integration and optimization, convergence diagnoses, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, including Metropolis Hastings and Gibbs algorithms, and adaptive algorithms. All chapters include exercises and all R programs are available as an R package called mcsm. The book appeals to anyone with a practical interest in simulation methods but no previous exposure. It is meant to be useful for students and practitioners in areas such as statistics, signal processing, communications engineering, control theory, econometrics, finance and more. The programming parts are introduced progressively to be accessible to any reader.},

We use data from the British Household Panel Survey in a fixed effects framework that includes variables known to determine psychological health, as well as factors which may provide compensation for commuting such as income, job satisfaction and housing quality. Our results show that, even after these variables are considered, commuting has an important detrimental effect on the psychological health of women, but not men, and this result is robust to numerous different specifications. We explore explanations for this gender difference and can find no evidence that it is due to women's shorter working hours or weaker occupational position. Rather women's greater sensitivity to commuting time seems to be a result of their larger responsibility for day-to-day household tasks, including childcare and housework.},

  abstract = {ISSUE ADDRESSED: Overseas research shows that fatality and injury risks per cyclist and pedestrian are lower when there are more cyclists and pedestrians. Do Australian data follow the same exponential 'growth rule' where (Injuries)/(Amount of cycling) is proportional to ((Amount of cycling)-0.6)? METHOD: Fatality and injury risks were compared using three datasets: 1) fatalities and amounts of cycling in Australian States in the 1980s; 2) fatality and injury rates over time in Western Australia as cycling levels increased; and 3) deaths, serious head injuries and other serious injuries to cyclists and pedestrians in Victoria, before and after the fall in cycling with the helmet law. RESULTS: In Australia, the risks of fatality and injury per cyclist are lower when cycling is more prevalent. Cycling was safest and most popular in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), Queensland and Western Australia (WA). New South Wales residents cycled only 47\% as much as residents of Queensland and WA, but had 53\% more fatalities per kilometre, consistent with the growth rule prediction of 52\% more for half as much cycling. Cycling also became safer in WA as more people cycled. Hospitalisation rates per 10,000 regular cyclists fell from 29 to 15, and reported deaths and serious injuries from 5.6 to 3.8 as numbers of regular cyclists increased. In Victoria, after the introduction of compulsory helmets, there was a 30\% reduction in cycling and it was associated with a higher risk of death or serious injury per cyclist, outweighing any benefits of increased helmet wearing. CONCLUSIONS: As with overseas data, the exponential growth rule fits Australian data well. If cycling doubles, the risk per kilometre falls by about 34\%; conversely, if cycling halves, the risk per kilometre will be about 52\% higher. Policies that adversely influence the amount of cycling (for example, compulsory helmet legislation) should be reviewed.},

A decade later, Karl Pearson developed the index that we still use to measure correlation, Pearson's r. Our article is written in recognition of the 100th anniversary of Galton's first discussion of regression and correlation. We begin with a brief history. Then we present 13 different formulas, each of which represents a different computational and conceptual definition of r. Each formula suggests a different way of thinking about this index, from algebraic, geometric, and trigonometric settings. We show that Pearson's r (or simple functions of r) may variously be thought of as a special type of mean, a special type of variance, the ratio of two means, the ratio of two variances, the slope of a line, the cosine of an angle, and the tangent to an ellipse, and may be looked at from several other interesting perspectives.},

Doi.: 10.7818/ECOS.2016.25-2.11    Most scientific papers are not reproducible: it is really hard, if not impossible, to understand how results are derived from data, and being able to regenerate them in the future (even by the same researchers). However, traceability and reproducibility of results are indispensable elements of high-quality science, and an increasing requirement of many journals and funding sources. Reproducible studies include code able to regenerate results from the original data. This practice not only provides a perfect record of the whole analysis but also reduces the probability of errors and facilitates code reuse, thus accelerating scientific progress. But doing reproducible science also brings many benefits to the individual researcher, including saving time and effort, improved collaborations, and higher quality and impact of final publications. In this article we introduce reproducible science, why it is important, and how we can improve the reproducibility of our work. We introduce principles and tools for data management, analysis, version control, and software management that help us achieve reproducible workflows in the context of ecology.},

The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality related to changes in physical activity level, exposure to fine particulate matter air pollution with a diameter \&lt;2.5 {$\mu$}m, as well as traffic fatalities in the cities of Barcelona, Basel, Copenhagen, Paris, Prague, and Warsaw. All scenarios produced health benefits in the six cities. An increase in bicycle trips to 35\% of all trips (as in Copenhagen) produced the highest benefits among the different scenarios analysed in Warsaw 113 (76\textendash 163) annual deaths avoided, Prague 61 (29\textendash 104), Barcelona 37 (24\textendash 56), Paris 37 (18\textendash 64) and Basel 5 (3\textendash 9). An increase in walking trips to 50\% of all trips (as in Paris) resulted in 19 (3\textendash 42) deaths avoided annually in Warsaw, 11(3\textendash 21) in Prague, 6 (4\textendash 9) in Basel, 3 (2\textendash 6) in Copenhagen and 3 (2\textendash 4) in Barcelona. The scenarios would also reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the six cities by 1,139 to 26,423 (metric tonnes per year). Policies to promote active transportation may produce health benefits, but these depend of the existing characteristics of the cities. Increased collaboration between health practitioners, transport specialists and urban planners will help to introduce the health perspective in transport policies and promote active transportation.},

In this work, which for the first time described the geography of the entire inhabited world as it was then known, Eratosthenes of Kyrene (ca. 285-205 BC) invented the discipline of geography as we understand it. A polymath who served as librarian at Alexandria and tutor to the future King Ptolemy IV, Eratosthenes created the terminology of geography, probably including the word geographia itself. Building on his previous work, in which he determined the size and shape of the earth, Eratosthenes in the Geographika created a grid of parallels and meridians that linked together every place in the world: for the first time one could figure out the relationship and distance between remote localities, such as northwest Africa and the Caspian Sea. The Geographika also identified some four hundred places, more than ever before, from Thoule (probably Iceland) to Taprobane (Sri Lanka), and from well down the coast of Africa to Central Asia. This is the first collation of the more than 150 fragments of the Geographika in more than a century. Each fragment is accompanied by an English translation, a summary, and commentary. Duane W. Roller provides a rich background, including a history of the text and its reception, a biography of Eratosthenes, and a comprehensive account of ancient Greek geographical thought and of Eratosthenes' pioneering contribution to it. This edition also includes maps that show all of the known places named in the Geographika, appendixes, a bibliography, and indexes.},

In addition, economic costs in terms of disease, work absentism and health systems, must be considered. It has been calculated that medical cost of active people is a thirty percent lower than that by inactive subjects.

He wrote a Computus or astronomical treatise in Latin in about 814\textendash 16, which contains a chapter on triangular and square numbers. Dicuil describes two methods for calculating triangular numbers: the simple method of summing the natural numbers, and the more complex method of multiplication, equivalent to the formula n(n + 1)/2. He also states that a square number is equal to twice a triangular number minus the generating number, equivalent to n2 = 2[n(n + 1)/2] \textendash{} n. The multiplication formula for triangular numbers was first explicitly described in about the third century AD by the Greek authors Diophantus and Iamblichus. It was also known as a solution to other mathematical problems as early as 300 BC. It reappeared in the West in the sixteenth century. Dicuil thus fills a gap in our medieval knowledge.},

The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C. Python is also suitable as an extension language for highly customizable C applications such as editors or window managers. Python is available for various operating systems, amongst which several flavors of UNIX (including Linux), the Apple Macintosh O.S., MS-DOS, MS-Windows 3.1, Windows NT, and OS/2. This reference manual describes the syntax and ``core semantics'''' of the language. It is terse, but attempts to be exact and complete. The semantics of non-essential built-in object types and of the built-in functions and modules are described in the Python Library Reference. For an informal introduction to the language, see the Python Tutorial.}

One of the topics commonly discussed is the role climate change may or may not have played in influencing an event. Here, we examine Twitter posts that mentioned climate change in the context of three high-magnitude extreme weather events \textendash{} Hurricane Irene, Hurricane Sandy and Snowstorm Jonas \textendash{} in order to assess how the framing of the topic and the attention paid to it can vary between events. We also examine the role that contextual factors can play in shaping climate change coverage on the platform. We find that criticism of climate change denial dominated during Irene, while political and ideological struggle frames dominated during Sandy. Discourse during Jonas was, in contrast, more divided between posts about the scientific links between climate change and the events, and posts contesting climate science in general. The focus on political and ideological struggle frames during Sandy reflects the event's occurrence at a time when the Occupy movement was active and the 2012 US Presidential Election was nearing. These factors, we suggest, could also contribute to climate change being a more prominent discussion point during Sandy than during Irene or Jonas. The Jonas frames, meanwhile, hint at lesser public understanding of how climate change may influence cold weather events when compared with tropical storms. Overall, our findings demonstrate how event characteristics and short-term socio-political context can play a critical role in determining the lenses through which climate change is viewed.},

Illicit drug users aged 18\textendash 40 were recruited through RDS (N = 401) and targeted street outreach (TSO) (N = 210) in New York City. Using the Google Maps API\texttrademark, we calculated travel distances and times using public transportation between each participant's recruitment location and the study office and between RDS recruiter\textendash recruit pairs. We used K function analysis to evaluate and compare spatial clustering of (1) RDS vs. TSO respondents and (2) RDS seeds vs. RDS peer recruits. All participant recruitment locations clustered around the study office; however, RDS participants were significantly more likely to be recruited within walking distance of the study office than TSO participants. The TSO sample was also less spatially clustered than the RDS sample, which likely reflects (1) the van's ability to increase the sample's geographic heterogeneity and (2) that more TSO than RDS participants were enrolled on the van. Among RDS participants, individuals recruited spatially proximal peers, geographic coverage did not increase as recruitment waves progressed, and peer recruits were not less spatially clustered than seeds. Using a mobile van to recruit participants had a greater impact on the geographic coverage and spatial dependence of the TSO than the RDS sample. Future studies should consider and evaluate the impact of the recruitment approach on the geographic/spatial representativeness of the sample and how spatial biases, including the preferential recruitment of proximal peers, could impact the precision and accuracy of estimates.},

  abstract = {A search model of the labor market is augmented to include commuting time to work. The theory posits that wages are positively related to commute distance, by a factor itself depending negatively on the bargaining power of workers. Since not all combinations of distance and wages are accepted, there is non-random selection of accepted job offers. We build on these ingredients to explore in the data the relationship between wages and commute time. We find that neglecting to account for this selection will bias downward the wage impact of commuting, and marginally affect the coefficients on education, age and gender. The correlation between the residuals of the selectivity equation and the distance equation is -0.70, showing the large impact of commute time on job acceptance decisions. We also use the theory to calculate the bargaining power of workers which largely varies depending on demographic groups: it appears to be much larger for men than that for women and that the bargaining power of women with young children is essentially zero. Un mod\`ele de recherche d'emploi est \'etendu pour prendre en consid\'eration le temps n\'ecessaire pour se rendre au travail. La th\'eorie postule que les salaires sont positivement li\'es \`a la distance de d\'eplacement, par un facteur lui-m\^eme reli\'e n\'egativement au pouvoir de n\'egociation des travailleurs. Puisque toutes les combinaisons de distances et de salaires ne sont pas acceptables, il y a une s\'election non al\'eatoire des offres d'emploi accept\'ees. Nous nous appuyons sur ces consid\'erations pour explorer dans les donn\'ees la relation entre les salaires et le temps de d\'eplacement. Nous constatons que n\'egliger cet effet de s\'election conduit \`a sous-estimer l'impact sur le salaire du temps de transport, et affecte marginalement les coefficients sur l'\'education, l'\^age et le sexe. La corr\'elation entre les r\'esidus de l'\'equation de s\'election et de l'\'equation de distance est -0,70, montrant l'impact consid\'erable du temps de d\'eplacement sur les d\'ecisions d'acceptation d'emplois.

But what happens if we actually succeed?Creating superior intelligence would be the biggest event in human history. Unfortunately, according to the world's pre-eminent AI expert, it could also be the last.  In this groundbreaking book on the biggest question facing humanity, Stuart Russell explains why he has come to consider his own discipline an existential threat to our species, and lays out how we can change course before it's too late. There is no one better placed to assess the promise and perils of the dominant technology of the future than Russell, who has spent decades at the forefront of AI research. Through brilliant analogies and crisp, lucid prose, he explains how AI actually works, how it has an enormous capacity to improve our lives - but why we must ensure that we never lose control of machines more powerful than we are. Here Russell shows how we can avert the worst threats by reshaping the foundations of AI to guarantee that machines pursue our objectives, not theirs.  Profound, urgent and visionary, Human Compatible is the one book everyone needs to read to understand a future that is coming sooner than we think.},

  abstract = {Increasing regular physical activity is a key public health goal. One strategy is to change the physical environment to encourage walking and cycling, requiring partnerships with the transport and urban planning sectors. Economic evaluation is an important factor in the decision to fund any new transport scheme, but techniques for assessing the economic value of the health benefits of cycling and walking have tended to be less sophisticated than the approaches used for assessing other benefits. This study aimed to produce a practical tool for estimating the economic impact of reduced mortality due to increased cycling. The tool was intended to be transparent, easy to use, reliable, and based on conservative assumptions and default values, which can be used in the absence of local data. It addressed the question: For a given volume of cycling within a defined population, what is the economic value of the health benefits? The authors used published estimates of relative risk of all-cause mortality among regular cyclists and applied these to levels of cycling defined by the user to produce an estimate of the number of deaths potentially averted because of regular cycling. The tool then calculates the economic value of the deaths averted using the "value of a statistical life." The outputs of the tool support decision making on cycle infrastructure or policies, or can be used as part of an integrated economic appraisal. The tool's unique contribution is that it takes a public health approach to a transport problem, addresses it in epidemiologic terms, and places the results back into the transport context. Examples of its use include its adoption by the English and Swedish departments of transport as the recommended methodologic approach for estimating the health impact of walking and cycling.},

Despite this, there is little research on travel mode choice at commuter universities and, in particular, the nonlinear spatial relationships among active travel potential and various contextual and compositional factors. The purpose of this study was to examine and visualize linkages among personal, household, density, diversity, and design factors, and active travel (bicycling, walking, and mass-transit modes) among a commuter-university population residing throughout southeastern Michigan, USA. This was accomplished by employing exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA), ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, and a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model. The GWR model outperformed the traditional OLS model in terms of goodness of fit (R2 = .534 and R2 = .461, respectively). A novel cartographic mapping technique was employed to depict where statistically significant parameter estimates negatively or positively influenced active travel. The main finding was that personal, household, density, diversity, and design estimates varied in both magnitude and spatiality throughout the university's study area. Interestingly, distance was not a universal barrier to active travel potential. These variations emphasize the importance of promoting active transportation through localized interventions as well as coordinating efforts among universities and surrounding communities.},

The adaptation of snowball sampling techniques, as described in this article, helped the authors to gain access to each of the more-vulnerable population groups of interest. The use of culturally sensitive recruitment strategies is both appropriate and effective in enlisting the involvement of members of vulnerable populations. Adaptations of snowball sampling strategies should be considered when recruiting participants for education programs or for research studies when the recruitment of a population-based sample is not essential.},

Constructs, methods, and findings from these fields can be applied by physical activity and health researchers to improve understanding of environmental influences on physical activity. In this review, neighborhood environment characteristics proposed to be relevant to walking/cycling for transport are defined, including population density, connectivity, and land use mix. Neighborhood comparison and correlational studies with nonmotorized transport outcomes are considered, with evidence suggesting that residents from communities with higher density, greater connectivity, and more land use mix report higher rates of walking/cycling for utilitarian purposes than low-density, poorly connected, and single land use neighborhoods. Environmental variables appear to add to variance accounted for beyond sociodemographic predictors of walking/cycling for transport. Implications of the transportation literature for physical activity and related research are outlined. Future research directions are detailed for physical activity research to further examine the impact of neighborhood and other physical environment factors on physical activity and the potential interactive effects of psychosocial and environmental variables. The transportation, urban design, and planning literatures provide a valuable starting point for multidisciplinary research on environmental contributions to physical activity levels in the population.},

  abstract = {Gilbert and Perl (2007) established how different epochs in human history came with specific ``transport revolutions.'' Our research suggests that intermodal approaches could constitute an invisible transport planning revolution.Based on a review defining ``social'' sustainability as it applies to urban passenger transportation, we consider the potential of an intermodal focus to better integrate non-motorized (walking-cycling) and public transportation. We start from the premise that rather than being a primary ``mono-mode'' such as buses or trains, sustainable transport is best understood as an ecology of modes with specific strengths and complementarities that can be mobilized through planning.Using data from Metropolitan Santiago (Chile), we explore this potential, from a conceptual, mainly social, and spatial perspective. We find that paying more attention to different formats of cycling, public transport integration could significantly improve low-cost alternatives for individual and feeder trips. Moreover, adjusting land use to non-work trip purposes could yield substantial benefits. This approach also offers the possibility of developing relatively simple tools helpful for improving the deliberative aspects of participatory planning, thereby increasing buy-in as well as improving health, efficiency, safety, and other benefits of sustainable transport.},

  abstract = {The interregional cohort survival model developed by Rogers is an excellent one that includes all of the three population processes: birth - death, aging, and interregional migration. Rogers's model, however, has been rarely implemented because it requires detailed data concerning cohortwise (that is by age and sex) interregional migration tables which are not usually available as published data. The most usual case is that only marginal tables that are from different sources can be obtained. However, in this case, those marginal tables necessarily show inconsistency in the sense that they do not have identical common submarginals. This inconsistency prevents the standard iterative proportional fitting (IPF) procedure from converging to the estimate of the complete migration table which conforms to the given observed marginals. Thus to implement Rogers's model some method is needed to estimate the complete migration table where only inconsistent marginals are available. In this paper a multistep IPF procedure is proposed for that purpose and an actual application of the proposed method is shown. The multistep IPF procedure has universal applicability to a wide class of general problems concerned with the estimation of a joint table under inconsistent marginals.},

In this paper, we present a novel methodology combining mapped survey responses (gathered using public participation GIS) and sophisticated multimodal routing analysis to understand patterns of suburban residents' daily mobility. Our particular focus is on residents' mode choices and their optimality in terms of travel time. We also examine the carbon-intensity of potential mode choice mismatches where a comparatively slower travel mode is chosen for a particular trip. This paper shows how the combination of the two data sources create new possibilities for analysing daily mobility by enabling the comparison of self-reported, geographically referenced mobility patterns and modelled, objectively ``optimal'' patterns. Our case study results from a rapidly growing metropolitan area, Greater Helsinki in Finland, indicate that people have rather sustainable daily mobility practices. Their daily trips are typically short (median 1.8~km), and non-motorised travel modes are the most popular. Also the share of car travel is significant. While public transport clearly has the lowest modal share, it is frequently used on longer trips to destinations where public transport connections are good (particularly the city centre). In 44\% of trips, the respondents choose the fastest travel mode. When a comparatively slower travel mode is chosen, it most often produces less CO2 emissions than the fastest mode. However, particularly on shopping trips \textendash{} the most commonly reported type of trip \textendash{} car driving dominates as the fastest means of transportation. When a slower mode is chosen on a shopping trip, it is typically more carbon-intensive than the fastest mode would have been in that case. The methodology presented here can be used to support local decision making, particularly when daily services and transport infrastructure are planned or reorganised.},

The goal of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of a `digital workshop', combining the interactive CommunityViz tool with the immersive lab facilities at the Collaborative for Advanced Landscape Planning (CALP). In support of the larger community planning process, two 3-h workshops were held at CALP's Landscape Immersion Lab. To facilitate collaborative exploration, the interactive landscape visualisation and real-time data analysis capabilities of CommunityViz were employed to illustrate the possible outcomes of residential density policies for Bowen Island's Snug Cove community. The community planning workshops were structured to provide the 14 semi-expert participants with the opportunity to explore and discuss the contentious residential density components of the draft Snug Cove Village Plan. The abilities to dynamically explore the visualisations of the planning proposals, and to see real-time changes in indicator metrics were considered particularly informative, and appeared to increase participants' understanding of the plan. Written and verbal responses indicated, however, that there was insufficient time to examine and interact with the information during the workshop, suggesting a need to examine in greater depth how and when these tools might best be employed in collaborative settings. Current and future research relating to this project is discussed.},

  abstract = {Bicycle sharing systems are increasingly being deployed in urban areas around the world, alongside online maps that disclose the state (i.e., location, number of bicycles/number of free parking slots) of stations in each city. Recent work has demonstrated how regularly monitoring these online maps allows for a granular analysis of a city's cycling trends; further, the literature indicates that different cities have unique spatio-temporal patterns, reducing the generalisability of any insights or models derived from a single system. In this work, we analyse 4.5 months of online bike-sharing map data from ten cities which, combined, have 996 stations. While an aggregate comparison supports the view of cities having unique usage patterns, results of applying unsupervised learning to the temporal data shows that, instead, only the larger systems display heterogeneous behaviour, indicating that many of these systems share intrinsic similarities. We further show how these similarities are reflected in the predictability of stations' occupancy data via a cross-city comparison of the error that a variety of approaches achieve when forecasting the number of bicycles that a station will have in the near future. We close by discussing the impact of uncovering these similarities on how future bicycle sharing systems can be designed, built, and managed.},

Starting from Alker Tripp's seminal ideas about city design, street morphology, and accident risk, this article summarizes results from an increasingly sophisticated line of enquiry at the boundaries between transport geography, network modeling, urban geography, and planning. It goes on to specify what we believe to be the most comprehensive study yet, based on five years' worth of road casualty data from London; GIS data on street morphology and physical features captured at a street-link unit of analysis; socio-economics and other determinants of accidents; and individual data about casualty victims. We test hypotheses about links between urban morphology and casualty severity using multi-level models with individual victim attributes at level-one, street-link morphology attributes (various measure of network connectivity) at level-two, and neighborhood descriptors at level-three.Results indicate that street-level morphology and design (expressed in terms of betweenness, divergence ratio, and hull radius), together with traffic volume and physical features of streets are all significantly associated with odds of ``Killed and Seriously Injured'' (KSI) causality incidents. We find the strongest evidence yet recorded that London's 20-MPH speed-restricted residential zones reduce the incidence of KSI; while neighborhood-level factors such as population density, deprivation of living environment, and access to services are also significant predictors of KSI indicating that selective urban territorial enclosure can save lives.},

Unobserved heterogeneity is modeled by allowing the parameters to vary randomly over individuals according to a continuous, discrete, or discrete-continuous mixture distribution, which must be chosen a priori by the researcher. In particular, the models supported by gmnl are the multinomial or conditional logit, the mixed multinomial logit, the scale heterogeneity multinomial logit, the generalized multinomial logit, the latent class logit, and the mixed-mixed multinomial logit. These models are estimated using either the maximum likelihood estimator or the maximum simulated likelihood estimator. This article describes and illustrates with real databases all functionalities of gmnl, including the derivation of individual conditional estimates of both the random parameters and willingness-to-pay measures.},

We shed light on what would make them definitely accepted and more used by planners to evaluate a range of urban and transport policies. In addition to literature review and our own experience dealing with urban planning agencies, we have interviewed different types of end users in France to identify their motivations and barriers to use LUTI models. The results show demand for a far more bottom-up oriented approach: the models should consider objectives and general needs of end users to live up to their expectations. Only a closer collaboration between modelers and end users, and more efforts to integrate modeling into urban planning, will make LUTIs considered as relevant approaches.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increasing active travel (primarily walking and cycling) has been widely advocated for reducing obesity levels and achieving other population health benefits. However, the strength of evidence underpinning this strategy is unclear. This study aimed to assess the evidence that active travel has significant health benefits. METHODS: The study design was a systematic review of (i) non-randomised and randomised controlled trials, and (ii) prospective observational studies examining either (a) the effects of interventions to promote active travel or (b) the association between active travel and health outcomes. Reports of studies were identified by searching 11 electronic databases, websites, reference lists and papers identified by experts in the field. Prospective observational and intervention studies measuring any health outcome of active travel in the general population were included. Studies of patient groups were excluded. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies from 12 countries were included, of which six were studies conducted with children. Five studies evaluated active travel interventions. Nineteen were prospective cohort studies which did not evaluate the impact of a specific intervention. No studies were identified with obesity as an outcome in adults; one of five prospective cohort studies in children found an association between obesity and active travel. Small positive effects on other health outcomes were found in five intervention studies, but these were all at risk of selection bias. Modest benefits for other health outcomes were identified in five prospective studies. There is suggestive evidence that active travel may have a positive effect on diabetes prevention, which may be an important area for future research. CONCLUSIONS: Active travel may have positive effects on health outcomes, but there is little robust evidence to date of the effectiveness of active transport interventions for reducing obesity. Future evaluations of such interventions should include an assessment of their impacts on obesity and other health outcomes.},

We show that the range of observed energy and GHG intensities of major transportation modes is remarkably similar and that occupancy explains about 70\textendash 90\% of the variation around the mean; only the remaining 10\textendash 30\% is explained by differences in trip distances and other factors such as technology and operating conditions. Whereas average occupancy levels differ vastly, they translate into roughly similar levels of energy and GHG intensity for nearly all major transportation modes.},

We address this gap with a six months long controlled natural field experiment and introduce a monetary and a non-monetary reward for eco-driving to drivers of light commercial vehicles in different branches of a logistics company. Our results show an average reduction of fuel consumption of 5\% due to a tangible non-monetary reward and suggest only a small reduction of the average fuel consumption in the equivalent monetary reward treatment. Building on the extant research on psychological determinants of transport behavior and economic incentives, we give possible explanations for the observed behavior and the potential superiority of non-monetary rewards over pure money.

  abstract = {Introduction: A promising way to stimulate physical activity is to promote the choice for active modes of transport (walking and cycling). Over the past years, several interventions and policies have been implemented to stimulate this mode shift. However, information concerning the effectiveness of these interventions and policies is still limited. The aim of the present study was to systematically review the effectiveness of interventions designed to stimulate a shift from car use to cycling or walking and to obtain insight into the intervention tools that have been used to promote and/or implement these interventions. Methods: Five databases were searched and articles published in English, Dutch, German, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish were included. Only studies that focussed on a mode shift from car use towards active transport in a general adult population, which were published in peer reviewed journals and which investigated effectiveness were included. Intervention tools used were categorized by using the model of Hoogerwerf \& Herweijer, as either legal, economic (subsidy, reward system, penalty), communicative (written materials, behavioural tools) and physical tools (providing bicycles, providing better bicycle facilities at work, adjustment of the environment). Results: Nineteen studies met our inclusion criteria. Studies included described workplace-based interventions, architectural and urbanistic adjustments, population-wide interventions, and bicycle-renting systems. Nearly all studies (except three) showed positive effects concerning a mode shift. Most of the included studies used more than one intervention tool and the tools used differed between types of interventions. However, information about the statistical significance of these results was often lacking and the study methodologies used were not of high quality. Conclusion: Nearly all studies showed results in a positive direction. However, the quality of the included studies was mostly low and intervention characteristics were poorly described. \'O 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {This paper studies changes in travel mode specific trip rates after life course (and accessibility) related key events from a gender perspective. It is theoretically informed by the mobility biographies approach, and by gender/travel studies. The data used is the German Mobility Panel (GMP) 1994 to 2010 in which households and their members are asked three times in three subsequent years to report the trips they made over a week. The changes reported are regressed to key events over the life course, cohort effects and period effects, while sociodemographics and spatial context attributes are controlled. A cluster-robust regression approach is used to account for the non-independent character of panel observations. Significant effects were found for some key events, including the birth of a child, entry into the labour market, and changes in spatial context, accessibility and mobility. Some effects differed distinctly between men and women, suggesting that men and women are differently affected by life course events. However, taken together the associations found, as well as their gender differences are rather limited. Hence, key events over the life course seem to be only loosely associated with travel mode specific trip rates. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Scientific literature lacks a model which combines exposure to risk, risk, and the relationship between them. This paper presents a conceptual road safety framework comprising mutually interacting factors for exposure to risk resulting from travel behaviour (volumes, modal split, and distribution of traffic over time and space) and for risk (crash and injury risk). The framework's three determinants for travel behaviour are locations of activities; resistances (generalized transport costs); needs, opportunities, and abilities. Crash and injury risks are modelled by the three 'safety pillars': infrastructure, road users and the vehicles they use. Creating a link in the framework between risk and exposure is important because of the 'non-linear relationship' between them, i.e. risk tends to decrease as exposure increases. Furthermore, 'perceived' risk (a type of travel resistance) plays a role in mode choice, i.e. the perception that a certain type of vehicle is unsafe can be a deterrent to its use. This paper uses theories to explain how the elements in the model interact. Cycling is an area where governments typically have goals for both mobility and safety. To exemplify application of the model, the paper uses the framework to link research on cycling (safety) to land use and infrastructure. The model's value lies in its ability to identify potential consequences of measures and policies for both exposure and risk. This is important from a scientific perspective and for policy makers who often have objectives for both mobility and safety.},

The papers in this supplement were presented at the 2008 Active Living Research Conference whose theme was "Connecting Active Living Research to Policy Solutions." The papers include evaluations of policy initiatives and research that suggests promising new policies. Commentaries propose principles for improving the translation of research to policy. Improving the rigor of research, asking policy-relevant questions, presenting country-specific data, and effectively communicating findings to policy makers are likely to contribute to greater impact of research on policy processes.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the number of electric bicycles on European, American and especially Chinese roads has increased substantially. Today, 11\% of all bicycles sold in Germany are e-bikes. Given their potential to reach higher maximum speeds, concerns have been raised about a possible increase in crash risk associated with e-bike use. However, as of now, it is unclear if and how often the potentially higher speed is actually reached in everyday cycling. As part of the German Naturalistic Cycling Study we measured and compared the speed of three bicycle types (conventional bicycles, pedelecs (pedalling supported up to 25 km/h), S-pedelecs (pedalling supported up to 45 km/h)) under naturalistic conditions. Ninety participants, divided in three age groups, took part in our study. Participants used their own bikes or e-bikes. The bicycles were equipped with a data acquisition system, which included sensors to record speed and distance, as well as two cameras. Data was collected over a period of four weeks for each participant. Nearly 17,000 km of cycling were recorded in total. The statistical analysis revealed significant differences in mean speed between all three bicycle types. Pedelec riders were, on average, 2 km/h faster than cyclists. S-pedelec speed was even 9 km/h higher. A similar pattern was also found when analysing free flow conditions and uphill or downhill cycling separately. The highest speed was measured on carriageways and bicycle infrastructure, regardless of bicycle type. Participants aged over 65 years rode significantly slower than younger participants. Data on acceleration from standstill largely confirm the differences between bicycle types and age groups. The results show that electric bicycles indeed reach higher speeds than conventional bicycles regularly. Although it is unclear if this also leads to an increase in crash risk, it can be assumed that the consequences of a crash might be, on average, more severe.},

  abstract = {Determining and understanding the environmental factors contributing to road traffic accident occurrence is of core importance in road safety research. In this study, a methodology to obtain robust and unbiased results when modeling imbalanced, high-resolution accident data is described. Based on a data set covering the whole highway network of Austria in a fine spatial (250 m) and temporal (1 h) scale, the effects of 48 covariates on accident occurrence are analyzed, with a special emphasis on real-time weather variables obtained through meteorological re-analysis. A balanced bagging approach is employed to cope with the issue of class imbalance. By fitting different tree-based classifiers to a large number of bootstrapped training samples, ensembles of binary classification models are established. The final prediction is achieved through majority vote across each ensemble, resulting in a robust prediction with reduced variance. Findings show the merits of the proposed approach in terms of model quality and robustness of the results, consistently displaying accuracies around 80\% while exhibiting sensitivities of approximately 50\%. In addition to certain features related to roadway geometrics, surface condition and traffic volume, a number of weather variables are found to be of importance for predicting accident occurrence. The proposed methodological take may not only pave the way for further analyses of high-resolution road safety data including real-time information, but can also be transferred to any other imbalanced classification problem.},

The European Commission estimates that ELVs contribute to approximately 1 \% of the total waste in Europe [9]. Other European Union strategies are considering more life cycle aspects, as well as other impacts including resource or climate change. This article is summarizing the results of a European Commission funded project (LIRECAR) that aims at identifying the environmental impacts and relevance for combinations of recycling / recovery and lightweight vehicle design options over the whole life cycle of a vehicle - i.e. manufacturing, use and recycling/recovery. Three, independent and scientific LCA experts reviewed the study according to ISO 14040.

Acceptance of the congestion charge was higher after the trial as opposed to its acceptability judgments before the trial. Respondents believed the charge had more positive consequences (viz., decreasing parking problems, congestion, and pollution) and less negative consequences (viz., financial cost increases) after the trial than they had expected beforehand. Furthermore, we examined the relative importance of various beliefs for the acceptability of the congestion charge before and after it was implemented. Results are that before the implementation of the charge acceptability was significantly related to beliefs about the expected consequences for one's own car use and financial costs, whereas acceptance after the trial was related to beliefs about the perceived consequences for one's own car use and parking problems. These results indicate that acceptance of the congestion charge had increased because people experienced positive consequences of the charge. This conclusion is discussed in the broader context in which the Stockholm trial took place.},

OTD is an approach to software/system development in which developers in different military, federal, commercial and possibly public organizations can collaboratively develop and maintain software or a system in a decentralized fashion. OTD depends on open standards and interfaces, open source software and designs, collaborative and distributed online tools, and technological agility. [OTD2006] In April 2006, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Advanced Systems and Concepts (AS\&C) published the Open Technology Development Roadmap [OTD2006]. The OTD Roadmap Plan focused on steps and recommendations to implement these practices within the Department of Defense. This document is divided into four chapters. The first briefly explains the context for OTD and why it is important to the U.S. military. Chapter 2 lays out the concrete steps for establishing, managing and distributing OTD projects within the government. Chapter 3 identifies programmatic procedures for OTD, including analyses of alternatives, the Request for Information/Request for Proposal (RFI/RFP) process, evaluating proposals, source selection, contracting language, and acceptance/approval criteria for deliverables. Chapter 4 deals with life-cycle management: transition, operations and maintenance, and leveraging a developer community for ongoing development.},

The authors also distinguish the probabilistic models from their estimation with data sets.  The first three chapters explain the whole process of Bayesian network modeling, from structure learning to parameter learning to inference. These chapters cover discrete Bayesian, Gaussian Bayesian, and hybrid networks, including arbitrary random variables.  The book then gives a concise but rigorous treatment of the fundamentals of Bayesian networks and offers an introduction to causal Bayesian networks. It also presents an overview of R and other software packages appropriate for Bayesian networks. The final chapter evaluates two real-world examples: a landmark causal protein signaling network paper and graphical modeling approaches for predicting the composition of different body parts.

Open innovation, like citizen participation, goes outside the boundaries of the organization to find solutions to problems and to hand ideas off to partners. A key technique for open innovation is ``crowdsourcing,'' issuing a challenge to a large and diverse group in hopes of arriving at new solutions more robust than those found inside the organization. The differences between citizen participation and Internet-based crowdsourcing are discussed. Crowdsourcing case studies are provided as a means for extending an emerging literature.},

Furthermore, leaving data in the global systems can create problems, either due to misprojection of imagery because of UTM zone boundaries, or because said projections are not optimised for local use. We developed the open-source Irish Earth Observation (IEO) Python module to maintain a local remote sensing data library for Ireland. This pure Python module, in conjunction with the IEOtools Python scripts, utilises the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) for its geoprocessing functionality. At present, the module supports only Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI/TIRS data that have been corrected to surface reflectance using the USGS/ESPA LEDAPS/ LaSRC Collection 1 architecture. This module and the IEOtools catalogue available Landsat data from the USGS/EROS archive, and includes functions for the importation of imagery into a defined local projection and calculation of cloud-free vegetation indices. While this module is distributed with default values and data for Ireland, it can be adapted for other regions with simple modifications to the configuration files and geospatial data sets.},

However, traffic measurements are undertaken only for a part of the road network with minor roads usually excluded. This paper suggests a methodology to estimate AADT in England and Wales applicable across the full road network, so that traffic for both major and minor roads can be approximated. This is achieved by consolidating clustering and regression modelling and using a comprehensive set of variables related to roadway, socioeconomic and land use characteristics. The methodological output reveals traffic patterns across urban and rural areas as well as produces accurate results for all road classes. Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forest (RF) are found to outperform the traditional Linear Regression, although the findings suggest that data clustering is key for significant reduction in prediction errors.},

  abstract = {The proximity and speed of motor traffic passing cyclists in non-separated conditions may be so close and so great as to cause discomfort. A variety of road design and driver behaviour factors may affect overtaking speeds and distances. The investigation presented in this paper builds on previous research and fills gaps in that research by considering the presence of cycle lanes on 20mph and 30mph roads, different lane widths, different lane markings, vehicle type, vehicle platooning and oncoming traffic. Data were collected from a bicycle ridden a distance of one metre from the kerb fitted with an ultrasonic distance detector and forward and sideways facing cameras. Reduced overtaking speeds correlate with narrower lanes, lower speed limits, and the absence of centre-line markings. Drivers passed slower if driving a long vehicle, driving in a platoon, and when approaching vehicles in the opposing carriageway were within five seconds of the passing point. Increased passing distances were found where there were wider or dual lane roads, and in situations where oncoming vehicles were further away and not in a platoon. In mixed traffic conditions, cyclists will be better accommodated by wider cross-sections, lower speed limits and the removal of the centre-line marking.},

The data include socioeconomic information, such as age, gender and income. The results indicate that these three factors may play unexpected roles in the length of bicycle commuting travel times for the journey-to-work trips. This study also suggests that separated bicycle paths play an integral part in the overall bicycle transportation network. Statistical analysis also indicated that cyclists traveling primarily on separated paths tend to make significantly longer trips.},

There are few, if any, approaches that successfully address the two goals simultaneously. To the best of our knowledge, such algorithms that give theoretical bounds on the future performance have not been proposed so far in the context of the classification of gene expression data. In this work, we investigate the premise of learning a conjunction (or disjunction) of decision stumps in Occam's Razor, Sample Compression, and PAC-Bayes learning settings for identifying a small subset of attributes that can be used to perform reliable classification tasks. We apply the proposed approaches for gene identification from DNA microarray data and compare our results to those of the well known successful approaches proposed for the task. We show that our algorithm not only finds hypotheses with much smaller number of genes while giving competitive classification accuracy but also have tight risk guarantees on future performance unlike other approaches. The proposed approaches are general and extensible in terms of both designing novel algorithms and application to other domains.},

Previous approaches to this have involved proprietary or one-off tools that are inconsistent and difficult to evaluate. In contrast, e-mission is an open-source, extensible software platform that consists of (a) an app for survey participants to install on their Android or iOS smartphones and (b) cloud-hosted software for managing the collected data. e-mission collects continuous location data, user-initiated annotations, and responses to contextual, platform initiated survey questions. New studies can be set up using the existing University of California, Berkeley, infrastructure with no additional coding, or the platform can be extended for more complex projects. This paper reviews the requirements for smartphone travel data collection, describes the architecture and capabilities of the e-mission platform, and evaluates its performance in a pilot deployment. The results show that the platform is usable, with over 150 installations in a month; stable, with over 85\% of users retaining it for more than 3 days; and extensible, with interface and survey customizations accomplished in a little over a week of full-time work by a transportation engineering researcher. We hope that e-mission will be a useful tool for app-based data collection and will serve as a catalyst for related research.},

In this Perspective we systematically review the evidence from 'real life' transport policies and their impacts on health and CO2 emissions. We identified a few studies that mostly involved personalized travel planning and showed modest increases in active transport such as walking, and reductions in vehicle use and CO2 emissions. Given the poor quality of the studies identified, urgent action is needed to provide more robust evidence for policies.},

This paper reviews how the trade-off between behavioural realism and complexity, one of the main challenges facing the travel-demand modeler, is made in the best practical activity-based models. It proposes an approach that captures key behavioural aspects and policy sensitivities, while remaining practical with reasonable requirements of computational resources. The three main model elements in this trade-off\textemdash model structure, data, and application method\textemdash are analysed. Drawing on examples from a model developed for Tel Aviv and from existing US models, this paper shows that behavioural realism and policy sensitivity can be achieved with a reasonable level of model complexity.},

  abstract = {We present a prototype mobile phone application that implements a novel transportation mode detection algorithm. The application is designed to run in the background, and continuously collects data from built-in acceleration and network location sensors. The collected data is analyzed automatically and partitioned into activity segments. A key finding of our work is that walking activity can be robustly detected in the data stream, which, in turn, acts as a separator for partitioning the data stream into other activity segments. Each vehicle activity segment is then sub-classified according to the vehicle type. Our approach yields high accuracy despite the low sampling interval and does not require GPS data. As a result, device power consumption is effectively minimized. This is a very crucial point for large-scale real-world deployment. As part of an experiment, the application has been used by 495 samples, and our prototype provides 82\% accuracy in transportation mode classification for an experiment performed in Zurich, Switzerland. Incorporating location type information with this activity classification technology has the potential to impact many phenomena driven by human mobility and to enhance awareness of behavior, urban planning, and agent-based modeling.},

However, considerable distance remains between planning outcomes on the one hand and policy decisions and implementation on the other. This paper looks at the reasons for this difference form the perspective of the experience of the European Conference of Ministers of Transport. A first potential reason for the weaker than expected role of planning in infrastructure policies is the weak data availability. Institutional changes of the transport sector do not facilitate an the upgrade of their quality. Secondly, despite enormous efforts to improve planning methods and institutions there is no obvious convergence to a "best practice". This considerably contributes to the difficulties of international coordination of infrastructure policies, despite the growing demand for such coordination given the rapid processes of international economic integration. Finally, research should help to feed back the results of ex post evaluations of infrastructure investment projects and programs into the planning process.},

This is the history of how England's elite came to own our land, and an inspiring manifesto for how to open up our countryside once more. This book has been a long time coming. Since 1086, in fact. For centuries, England's elite have covered up how they got their hands on millions of acres of our land, by constructing walls, burying surveys and more recently, sheltering behind offshore shell companies. But with the dawn of digital mapping and the Freedom of Information Act, it's becoming increasingly difficult for them to hide.Trespassing through tightly-guarded country estates, ecologically ravaged grouse moors and empty Mayfair mansions, writer and activist Guy Shrubsole has used these 21st century tools to uncover a wealth of never-before-seen information about the people who own our land, to create the most comprehensive map of land ownership in England that has ever been made public.From secret military islands to tunnels deep beneath London, Shrubsole unearths truths concealed since the Domesday Book about who is really in charge of this country \textendash{} at a time when Brexit is meant to be returning sovereignty to the people. Melding history, politics and polemic, he vividly demonstrates how taking control of land ownership is key to tackling everything from the housing crisis to climate change \textendash{} and even halting the erosion of our very democracy.It's time to expose the truth about who owns England \textendash{} and finally take back our green and pleasant land.},

Useful information about news and geopolitical events lies embedded in the Twitter stream, which embodies, in the aggregate, Twitter users' perspectives and reactions to current events. By virtue of sheer volume, content embedded in the Twitter stream may be useful for tracking or even forecasting behavior if it can be extracted in an efficient manner. In this study, we examine the use of information embedded in the Twitter stream to (1) track rapidly-evolving public sentiment with respect to H1N1 or swine flu, and (2) track and measure actual disease activity. We also show that Twitter can be used as a measure of public interest or concern about health-related events.

  abstract = {Spatial planning typically involves multiple stakeholders. To any specific planning problem, stakeholders often bring different levels of knowledge about the components of the problem and make assumptions, reflecting their individual experiences, that yield conflicting views about desirable planning outcomes. Consequently, stakeholders need to learn about the likely outcomes that result from their stated preferences; this learning can be supported through enhanced access to information, increased public participation in spatial decision-making and support for distributed collaboration amongst planners, stakeholders and the public. This paper presents a conceptual system framework for web-based GIS that supports public participation in collaborative planning. The framework combines an information area, a Multi-Criteria Spatial Decision Support System (MC-SDSS) and an argumentation map to support distributed and asynchronous collaboration in spatial planning. After analysing the novel aspects of this framework, the paper describes its implementation, as a proof of concept, in a system for Web-based Participatory Wind Energy Planning (WePWEP). Details are provided on the specific implementation of each of WePWEP's four tiers, including technical and structural aspects. Throughout the paper, particular emphasis is placed on the need to support user learning throughout the planning process. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Despite its widespread use, it relies on adjustable parameters that vary from region to region and suffers from known analytic inconsistencies. Here we introduce a stochastic process capturing local mobility decisions that helps us analytically derive commuting and mobility fluxes that require as input only information on the population distribution. The resulting radiation model predicts mobility patterns in good agreement with mobility and transport patterns observed in a wide range of phenomena, from long-term migration patterns to communication volume between different regions. Given its parameter-free nature, the model can be applied in areas where we lack previous mobility measurements, significantly improving the predictive accuracy of most of the phenomena affected by mobility and transport processes.},

This study uses causal impact estimation techniques to determine if a controversial conservation policy\textemdash the Vegetation Management Act (VMA)\textemdash has successfully reduced deforestation of remnant trees in the Brigalow Belt South, a 21.6 Mha biodiversity hotspot in Queensland. We use covariate matching to determine the regulatory effect of the policy on deforestation rates over time, compared to two counterfactual scenarios representing upper and lower estimates of policy impact. The VMA significantly reduced the rate of remnant deforestation in the highest impact scenario, saving 17, 729 {$\pm$} 1733 ha during 2000\textendash 2016. In the lowest scenario, `panic clearing' before and after enactment of the VMA minimized the amount of remnant forests saved and may have marginally increased deforestation relative to the counterfactual (-404 {$\pm$} 617 ha). At peak effectiveness, the VMA successfully counteracted the amount of remnant deforestation during 2010\textendash 2012, but this only represents 4.78\% of the 371, 252 ha of remnant forests cleared in the bioregion since enactment in 1999. Thus, while deforestation rates in the region have substantially reduced since the policy was enacted, our results of positive yet limited direct regulatory impact suggests the policy's effectiveness is strongly confounded by other deforestation drivers, like changing socio-economic or climate conditions, as well as new social signals provoked by the policy. The mechanisms through which the policy influences deforestation behavior must be further investigated to ensure real, desirable change is achieved.},

This paper implements a new estimation technique for the modelling of CO2 emissions linked with the school commute that integrates both transport network-level routing and geographically disaggregate vehicle emissions data. The model is then applied to a national cohort of pupils in England. Areas demonstrating the highest emissions were typically more rural and/or comprising more affluent resident populations. Emissions were also shown to increase with school year, with larger step changes between educational stages reflecting the different geography of school locations. Furthermore, where secondary school entry policies were selective or based on a religious domination, average emissions were typically higher than in non-selective schools.},

We aimed to assess the effects on respiratory and cardiovascular responses of walking down a busy street with high levels of pollution compared with walking in a traffic-free area with lower pollution levels in older adults.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}In this randomised, crossover study, we recruited men and women aged 60 years and older with angiographically proven stable ischaemic heart disease or stage 2 Global initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) COPD who had been clinically stable for 6 months, and age-matched healthy volunteers. Individuals with ischaemic heart disease or COPD were recruited from existing databases or outpatient respiratory and cardiology clinics at the Royal Brompton \& Harefield NHS Foundation Trust and age-matched healthy volunteers using advertising and existing databases. All participants had abstained from smoking for at least 12 months and medications were taken as recommended by participants' doctors during the study. Participants were randomly assigned by drawing numbered disks at random from a bag to do a 2 h walk either along a commercial street in London (Oxford Street) or in an urban park (Hyde Park). Baseline measurements of participants were taken before the walk in the hospital laboratory. During each walk session, black carbon, particulate matter (PM) concentrations, ultrafine particles, and nitrogen dioxide (NO\textsubscript{2}) concentrations were measured.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Between October, 2012, and June, 2014, we screened 135 participants, of whom 40 healthy volunteers, 40 individuals with COPD, and 39 with ischaemic heart disease were recruited. Concentrations of black carbon, NO\textsubscript{2}, PM\textsubscript{10}, PM\textsubscript{2.5}, and ultrafine particles were higher on Oxford Street than in Hyde Park. Participants with COPD reported more cough (odds ratio [OR] 1{$\cdot$}95, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}96\textendash 3{$\cdot$}95; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}1), sputum (3{$\cdot$}15, 1{$\cdot$}39\textendash 7{$\cdot$}13; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}05), shortness of breath (1{$\cdot$}86, 0{$\cdot$}97\textendash 3{$\cdot$}57; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}1), and wheeze (4{$\cdot$}00, 1{$\cdot$}52\textendash 10{$\cdot$}50; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}05) after walking down Oxford Street compared with Hyde Park. In all participants, irrespective of their disease status, walking in Hyde Park led to an increase in lung function (forced expiratory volume in the first second [FEV\textsubscript{1}] and forced vital capacity [FVC]) and a decrease in pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index up to 26 h after the walk. By contrast, these beneficial responses were attenuated after walking on Oxford Street. In participants with COPD, a reduction in FEV\textsubscript{1} and FVC, and an increase in R5\textendash 20 were associated with an increase in during-walk exposure to NO\textsubscript{2}, ultrafine particles and PM\textsubscript{2.5}, and an increase in PWV and augmentation index with NO\textsubscript{2} and ultrafine particles.

Many aspects of this crisis are all too familiar to us: the destruction of tropical rainforests, the hole in the Antarctic ozone layer, desertification, and soil erosion. Yet we avoid the underlying challenge of a rapidly deteriorating ecological system and the breadth and complexity of the response that is required. Vaclav Smil evaluates the current state of knowledge concerning atmospheric change. Recognizing the limits of scientific studies and quantitative modeling, Smil analyzes the weaknesses and uncertainties of our environmental understanding and provides a discussion of the levels of food, energy, water and materials necessary to support a decent quality of life. This timely and crucial study explores the promises and problems of different paths towards global management. With a focus on the importance of flexibleresponse, it provides an analysis of both social and environmental needs. It will further our understanding of biospheric change and of our abilities and weaknesses in managing the transition to a sustainable society.},

However, most rely on the potentially detrimental process of integerisation if a whole individual population is required, e.g. for use in agent-based modelling (ABM). This paper describes and investigates the use of quasirandom sequences to sample populations from known marginal constraints whilst preserving those marginal distributions. We call this technique Quasirandom Integer Without-replacement Sampling (QIWS) and show that the statistical properties of quasirandomly sampled populations to be superior to those of pseudorandomly sampled ones in that they tend to yield entropies much closer to populations generated using the entropy-maximising iterative proportional fitting (IPF) algorithm. The implementation is extremely efficient, easily outperforming common IPF implementations. It is freely available as an open source R package called humanleague. Finally, we suggest how the current limitations of the implementation can be overcome, providing a direction for future work.},

  abstract = {Background: Evidence is mounting to suggest a causal relationship between the built environment and people's physical activity behaviours, particularly active transport. The evidence base has been hindered to date by restricted consideration of cost and economic factors associated with built environment interventions, investigation of socioeconomic or ethnic differences in intervention effects, and an inability to isolate the effect of the built environment from other intervention types. The aims of this systematic review were to identify which environmental interventions increase physical activity in residents at the local level, and to build on the evidence base by considering intervention cost, and the differential effects of interventions by ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Methods: A systematic database search was conducted in June 2015. Articles were eligible if they reported a quantitative empirical study (natural experiment or a prospective, retrospective, experimental, or longitudinal research) investigating the relationship between objectively measured built environment feature(s) and physical activity and/or travel behaviours in children or adults. Quality assessment was conducted and data on intervention cost and whether the effect of the built environment differed by ethnicity or socioeconomic status were extracted. Results: Twenty-eight studies were included in the review. Findings showed a positive effect of walkability components, provision of quality parks and playgrounds, and installation of or improvements in active transport infrastructure on active transport, physical activity, and visits or use of settings. There was some indication that infrastructure improvements may predominantly benefit socioeconomically advantaged groups. Studies were commonly limited by selection bias and insufficient controlling for confounders. Heterogeneity in study design and reporting limited comparability across studies or any clear conclusions to be made regarding intervention cost. Conclusions: Improving neighbourhood walkability, quality of parks and playgrounds, and providing adequate active transport infrastructure is likely to generate positive impacts on activity in children and adults. The possibility that the benefits of infrastructure improvements may be inequitably distributed requires further investigation. Opportunities to improve the quality of evidence exist, including strategies to improve response rates and representativeness, use of valid and reliable measurement tools, cost-benefit analyses, and adequate controlling for confounders.},

  abstract = {With federal policy beginning to shift from auto-centric planning, provision for pedestrian and bicycle access is now mandated in federally supported projects. However, the field of transportation planning has little in the way of theory and methods to guide design and planning for walkable cities. Walkability is increasingly valued for a variety of reasons. Not only does pedestrian transportation reduce congestion and have low environmental impact, it has social and recreational value. Recent research suggests that walking also promotes mental and physical health. The quality of the pedestrian environment is key to encouraging people to choose walking over driving. Six criteria are presented for design of a successful pedestrian network: (1) connectivity; (2) linkage with other modes; (3) fine grained land use patterns; (4) safety; (5) quality of path; and (6) path context. To achieve walkable cities in the United States it will be necessary to assess current walkability conditions, revise standards and regulations, research walking behavior in varied settings, promote public education and participation in pedestrian planning, and encourage collaboration and interdisciplinary education between transportation engineers and the design professions.

The road network supports a variety of dependent economic activity and serves to integrate the economic system over space. More specifically the enhancement of the motorway network over the years in Britain will have affected the accessibility surface of the nation. This paper considers accessibility changes between the components of the urban system which are the result of postwar motorway construction. Three accessibility surfaces are considered based on various stages in the motorway building programme. A standard market potential accessibility measure is used to capture those accessibility changes which are due to the motorway effect over various periods of time and those which are due to the employment effect. The calculations are founded on the travel modes of cars and heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) based on a generalized measure of cost impedance. The results are presented for the familiar set of 19 local labour market area types based on some 280 functional urban regions and for the 11 Standard Regions based on some 852 amalgamated jobcentre office areas.},

  abstract = {Academic interest in utility cycling has burgeoned in recent years with significant literature relating to the health and environmental benefits of cycling, the efficacy of cycle-specific infrastructure, and the embodied experiences of cycling. Yet with few exceptions, none of these accounts conceptualizes cycling as a mode of neoliberal governance through which circulation and quality of labor are improved. This article seeks to address this absence, positioning cycling in relation to broader biopolitical and political\textendash economic governance in two ways: Focusing on the recent experiences of London (UK) it argues first that cycle promotion is a principally biopolitical ``mobility'' fix that seeks to operate through shaping individuals as entrepreneurs of the self who will move more efficiently. Second, and in relation to this biopolitics of cycling, it suggests that the minimal spatial fixing embodied in cycle-specific infrastructure represents a metaphorical fix resulting from tensions created between the enterprise of cycling, the realities of practicing it in hostile urban environments, and the temporary networks of actors that produce it as such. In doing so, the article contends that what is being materialized is a narrow productivist framing of cycling both materially and discursively in the shape of commuter-focused infrastructure and promotion that effectively marginalizes subaltern and alternative performances. The article concludes by arguing that theorizing the promotion and practice of cycling as part of broader processes of neoliberalization should help to direct future research agendas for cycling and critical mobilities scholarship more broadly.},

Obviously there is great inertia, a disinclination to enact change, in for instance environmentally detrimental practices. While there is much in the literature to explain inertia at the individual, organizational and societal level, there is a gap concerning approaches that focus upon the industrial level. This paper addresses this gap by developing an analytical approach based upon institutional theory brought together with the ontological principles of strong sustainability. Two interrelated case studies, concerning greenhouse gas reduction in the Swedish agrifield, are used to develop the approach. The empirical results show that greenhouse gas reduction is used in support for convergent changes within the industry, for instance to motivate increased efficiency and yields. Hence, the paper contributes to the sustainable development-literature by providing an analytical approach that can be utilized to increase the understanding of change processes at the industrial level. This approach is then discussed and further developed to accommodate for the case results.},

Our goal for the software is to package results of our algorithm engineering efforts and put them into the hands of domain experts. NetworKit is implemented as a hybrid combining the kernels written in C++ with a Python frontend, enabling integration into the Python ecosystem of tested tools for data analysis and scientific computing. The package provides a wide range of functionality (including common and novel analytics algorithms and graph generators) and does so via a convenient interface.

Through data collection and analysis of its content, it supports a greater mapping and understanding of the evolving human landscape. The information disseminated through such media represents a deviation from volunteered geography, in the sense that it is not geographic information per se. Nevertheless, the message often has geographic footprints, for example, in the form of locations from where the tweets originate, or references in their content to geographic entities. We argue that such data conveys ambient geospatial information, capturing for example, people's references to locations that represent momentary social hotspots. In this paper we address a framework to harvest such ambient geospatial information, and resulting hybrid capabilities to analyze it to support situational awareness as it relates to human activities. We argue that this emergence of ambient geospatial analysis represents a second step in the evolution of geospatial data availability, following on the heels of volunteered geographical information.},

Crossing the threshold would lead to a much higher global average temperature than any interglacial in the past 1.2 million years and to sea levels significantly higher than at any time in the Holocene. We examine the evidence that such a threshold might exist and where it might be. If the threshold is crossed, the resulting trajectory would likely cause serious disruptions to ecosystems, society, and economies. Collective human action is required to steer the Earth System away from a potential threshold and stabilize it in a habitable interglacial-like state. Such action entails stewardship of the entire Earth System\textemdash biosphere, climate, and societies\textemdash and could include decarbonization of the global economy, enhancement of biosphere carbon sinks, behavioral changes, technological innovations, new governance arrangements, and transformed social values.},

The cycling `renaissance' taking place to the greatest extent in gentrifying neighborhoods has been noted, but the processes relating cycling and gentrification have gone largely unexplored. This paper examines the early role that bicycle advocacy organizations in San Francisco played in articulating the specifically economic value of bicycle infrastructure investment. This narrative is now commonplace, and widely applied both to neighborhood revitalization and urban competition for `talent'. This alliance of bicycle advocacy with the `livable' turn of gentrification raises serious questions for those who would pursue a more democratic and socially just politics of the bicycle.},

  abstract = {As a form of `active transport', cycling has been encouraged as a route to improving population health. However, in many high-income countries, despite being widely seen as a `healthy' choice, few people do cycle for transport. Further, where cycling is rare, it is not a choice made equally across the population. In London, for instance, cycling is disproportionately an activity of affluent, White, men. This paper takes London as a case study to explore why the meanings of cycling might resonate differently across urban, gendered, ethnic and class identities. Drawing on qualitative interview data with 78 individuals, we suggest first that the relative visibility of cycling when few do it means that it is publicly gendered in a way that more normalised modes of transport are not; conversely, the very invisibility of Black and Asian cyclists reduces their opportunities to see cycling as a candidate mode of transport. Second, following Bourdieu, we argue that the affinities different population groups have for cycling may reflect the locally constituted `accomplishments' contained in cycling. In London, cycling represents the archetypal efficient mode for autonomous individuals to travel in ways that maximise their future-health gain, and minimise wasted time and dependence on others. However, it relies on the cultivation of a particular `assertive' style to defend against the risks of road danger and aggression. While the identities of some professional (largely White) men and women could be bolstered by cycling, the aesthetic and symbolic goals of cycling were less appealing to those with other class, gendered and ethnic identities.},

  abstract = {Forests are major components of the global carbon cycle, providing substantial feedback to atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Our ability to understand and predict changes in the forest carbon cycle-particularly net primary productivity and carbon storage-increasingly relies on models that represent biological processes across several scales of biological organization, from tree leaves to forest stands. Yet, despite advances in our understanding of productivity at the scales of leaves and stands, no consensus exists about the nature of productivity at the scale of the individual tree, in part because we lack a broad empirical assessment of whether rates of absolute tree mass growth (and thus carbon accumulation) decrease, remain constant, or increase as trees increase in size and age. Here we present a global analysis of 403 tropical and temperate tree species, showing that for most species mass growth rate increases continuously with tree size. Thus, large, old trees do not act simply as senescent carbon reservoirs but actively fix large amounts of carbon compared to smaller trees; at the extreme, a single big tree can add the same amount of carbon to the forest within a year as is contained in an entire mid-sized tree. The apparent paradoxes of individual tree growth increasing with tree size despite declining leaf-level and stand-level productivity can be explained, respectively, by increases in a tree's total leaf area that outpace declines in productivity per unit of leaf area and, among other factors, age-related reductions in population density. Our results resolve conflicting assumptions about the nature of tree growth, inform efforts to undertand and model forest carbon dynamics, and have additional implications for theories of resource allocation and plant senescence.},

Two studies generally support the hypothesized relationships and demonstrate links to the broader theory of values. However, the biospheric value orientation postulated in the theoretical literature on environmentalism does not differentiate from social-altruism in a general population sample. Results are discussed in terms of value change, the role of social structural factors (including gender) in environmentalism, theories of risk perception, and the mobilization strategies of social movements, including environmental justice movements.},

  abstract = {Background Much of the research into cyclist safety in Australia has focused on behaviour with less focus on the impact of the urban transport environment on cyclist safety. A greater understanding of the urban transport system and the improvements needed to create a safer cycling environment are essential if cyclists are to be safe and increased cycling participation targets are to be achieved. The proposed study will use existing cyclist crash data along with unique cyclist exposure data to develop road infrastructure prototypes that improve cyclists' safety and evaluate the effectiveness of these prototypes in a cycling simulator.Methods and design This study will be conducted in two Australian cities namely Perth and Melbourne as both cities have policies that strongly advocate cycling. Two methods of data collection will be employed: (1) in-depth crash investigations of injured cyclists; and (2) video footage of cyclist exposure through a naturalistic cycling study of non-injured cyclists. The findings from these two methods will be used to develop new urban road design prototypes which will be tested with a sample of cyclists and motorists in safe environment namely, a cycling simulator and a driving simulator.Discussion By designing and evaluating safer environments for cyclists, this study will identify solutions that reduce the risk of road trauma and importantly, support this alternative mode of transport and thereby contribute to a reduction in traffic-related emissions and pollution and enhance sustainable economic and social connectivity.},

Data used were gathered during an original survey effort conducted over the Internet in 2002. Empirical results are presented, and policy implications of these results for urban planning are discussed. In addition, deterrents and facilitators of bicycle commuting as reported by respondents in the survey are descriptively analyzed. Several findings from this research contribute to the state of the knowledge in bicycle commuting. First, the availability of showers or clothing lockers at the work place does not appear to inspire bicycle commuters to commute by bicycle more frequently. Second, using a bicycle for nonwork trip purposes increases an individual's frequency of commuting by bicycle to work. Other important results indicate that nonbicycle commuters either have misconceptions about the dangers of bicycling or else they lack convenient, safe route options for bicycling to work. Practitioners can use the ordered-response model to estimate an individual bicycle commuter's frequency of commuting by bicycle. The results can also help practitioners estimate the effects on nonmotorized mode share of programs that compete for funds to provide bicycling safety education, bicycle parking, and promotion of bicycling.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the modal share of cycling has been growing in North American cities. With the increase of cycling, the need of bicycle infrastructure and road safety concerns have also raised. Bicycle flows are an essential component in safety analysis. The main objective of this work is to propose a methodology to estimate and map bicycle volumes and cyclist injury risk throughout the entire network of road segments and intersections on the island of Montreal, achieved by combining smartphone GPS traces and count data. In recent years, methods have been proposed to estimate average annual daily bicycle (AADB) volume and injury risk estimates at both the intersection and segment levels using bicycle counts. However, these works have been limited to small samples of locations for which count data is available. In this work, a methodology is proposed to combine short- and long-term bicycle counts with GPS data to estimate AADB volumes along segments and intersections in the entire network. As part of the validation process, correlation is observed between AADB values obtained from GPS data and AADB values from count data, with R-squared values of 0.7 for signalized intersections, 0.58 for non-signalized intersections and between 0.48 and 0.76 for segments with and without bicycle infrastructure. The methodology is also validated through the calibration of safety performance functions using both sources of AADB estimates, from counts and from GPS data. Using the validated AADB estimates, the factors associated with injury risk were identified using data from the entire population of intersections and segments throughout Montreal. Bayesian injury risk maps are then generated and the concentrations of expected injuries and risk at signalized intersections are identified. Signalized intersections, which are often located at the intersection of major arterials, witness 4 times more injuries and 2.5 times greater risk than non-signalized intersections. A similar observation can be made for arterials which not only have a higher concentration of injuries but also injury rates (risk). On average, streets with cycle tracks have a greater concentration of injuries due to greater bicycle volumes, however, and in accordance with recent works, the individual risk per cyclist is lower, justifying the benefits of cycle tracks.

  year = {2011},
  abstract = {This thesis provides an integrated approach to common problems with location estimation for animal tracking. Many existing techniques confound problems of location accuracy with simplistic track representations and under-utilization of available data. Traditional techniques such as speed ltering and time spent maps are illustrated with a software package developed by the author with examples of location estimates from southern elephant seals. This software enables the application and exploration of various techniques that have previously not been available in a single solution. These include ltering, temporal gridding, projection transformation and GIS integration. A novel Bayesian approach is introduced for the more general problems faced by dierent tagging techniques. This approach integrates all sources of data including movement models, environmental data and prior knowledge. This general framework is illustrated by application to satellite tag data and light-measuring tag data. Examples are used to detail the use of movement models with a powerful track representation model, and the application of raw light data for location estimation. Previously under-utilized sources of data are used to inform location estimates. A method for applying light level geo-location within the framework is presented. This approach provides a primary location estimate for each twilight and utilizes all of the available data from archival tags. These model runs result in very large databases of samples from Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations and techniques for summarizing these for the variety of analysis outputs are illustrated. This system solves issues of location uncertainty with a full path representation and provides spatial maps of residency for multiple animals. The relation between archival tag data and ocean circulation is used to extend the application of archival tag data for location estimation for diving animals in a manner similar to commonly used SST methods. Diving proles from elephants seals are compared with 4D oceanographic datasets. Older tags are limited by problems with measurement lags for temperature|this problem is addressed with a proxy model for temperature at depth to ocean height. This thesis provides a number of important improvements to the derivation of location from various types of tag data by integrating disparate information sources in a systematic way. Location estimates are produced with inherent quantication of errors. The approach provides the variety of metrics and analysis types required with an extensible software package. These contributions help bridge the divides between various analytic techniques traditionally employed for animal tracking.},

Exposed fossil reef terraces suggest sea levels in excess of 7 meters in the last warm era, of which probably not much more than 2 meters are considered to originate from melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet. We simulate the evolution of the Antarctic Ice Sheet during the LIG with a 3D thermomechanical ice sheet model forced by an atmosphere ocean general circulation model (AOGCM). Our results show that high LIG sea levels, cannot be reproduced with the atmosphere-ocean forcing delivered by current AOGCMs. However, when taking reconstructed Southern Ocean temperature anomalies of several degrees, sensitivity studies indicate a Southern Ocean temperature anomaly threshold for total WAIS collapse of 2-3{$\circ$}C, accounting for a sea level rise of 3-4 meters during the LIG. Potential future Antarctic Ice Sheet dynamics range from a moderate retreat to a complete collapse, depending on rate and amplitude of warming.},

  abstract = {Ancient Perspectives encompasses a vast arc of space and time\textemdash Western Asia to North Africa and Europe from the third millennium BCE to the fifth century CE\textemdash to explore mapmaking and worldviews in the ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, and Rome. In each society, maps served as critical economic, political, and personal tools, but there was little consistency in how and why they were made. Much like today, maps in antiquity meant very different things to different people. Ancient Perspectives presents an ambitious, fresh overview of cartography and its uses. The seven chapters range from broad-based analyses of mapping in Mesopotamia and Egypt to a close focus on Ptolemy's ideas for drawing a world map based on the theories of his Greek predecessors at Alexandria. The remarkable accuracy of Mesopotamian city-plans is revealed, as is the creation of maps by Romans to support the proud claim that their emperor's rule was global in its reach. By probing the instruments and techniques of both Greek and Roman surveyors, one chapter seeks to uncover how their extraordinary planning of roads, aqueducts, and tunnels was achieved. Even though none of these civilizations devised the means to measure time or distance with precision, they still conceptualized their surroundings, natural and man-made, near and far, and felt the urge to record them by inventive means that this absorbing volume reinterprets and compares.},

We find that if the markets were perfectly competitive, then feed-in tariff and the certificate price would be the same. However, when the markets are imperfect, they are generally different. While both the tariff and certificate price fluctuate around the difference between the costs of green and black energy, the tariff deviates more from the cost difference than the certificate price. The supplies of both black and green energy under FIT are higher than TGC, obviously as a result of subsidies. A troubling outcome is that the total energy supply increases under FIT as the renewables quota increases, which can negate other measures to mitigate climate changes such as demand management. Finally, using the data from the UK market, we find that social welfare under TGC is consistently higher than FIT for a wide range of values of the parameters. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The rapid growth of the Internet has greatly improved the accessibility and transmission of all types of information including transportation and is changing the ways that spatial information is captured, managed and displayed. GIS are increasingly employed as a tool for public participation in planning. It is expected that integrating GIS with the Web could possess the potential to provide tremendous support to the public by empowering them with information and by providing interactive mapping capabilities for enhancing public participation in the transportation planning processes. This monograph will address the issue of Web GIS and PPGIS (Public Participation in GIS) and detail the implementation of technology, which can be used to support public participation in transportation planning. The primary objective of this study is to concentrate on developing a Web-based GIS application and to present the system design and functionalities through a case study that is the 37th Street SW Functional Planning Study in the City of Calgary, Alta., Canada. A website, including Web-based GIS mapping functions and online public discussion forums, is developed and its functionality discussed. This work remains at the developmental stage and further research will be necessary to improve the functionality, design and user-friendliness of the website.},

  abstract = {The accumulation of private automobiles in urban transportation networks has become a serious challenge in many developing countries. However, introduction of a competitive mode could dissuade the passengers from commuting by car and hence alleviate traffic congestion and its consequent environmental impacts. In the present study, we address this issue by proposing an innovative mathematical model that maximizes the competitiveness of Bike-and-Ride (B\&R) services in inter-zonal trips, where a stand-alone Bicycle Sharing System (BSS) is uncompetitive against the car. Considering both access and egress ends of trips for the first time in the literature, the model optimally lays out the B\&R network elements (a hierarchical set of BSS stations referred to as hubs, and their linking bicycle lanes) under budget constraints. Having selected the city of Isfahan as a case to implement our model on, we conduct experimental and sensitivity analyses to gain further insights into how different parameter settings affect the objective value. Results indicate significant modal shifts (from private automobiles toward B\&R) occur in solution networks yielded with limited budgets available. This confirms that unlike the existing BSSs that are shown to mainly substitute public transportation, if designed as a feeder mode with the objective of cutting private car trips, a BSS could be significantly effective in boosting public transportation ridership through attracting demand from private cars to B\&R. With value of time taken as an indicator of the passengers' income, it is found that affluent societies will be less likely to substitute their car for the B\&R mode if the latter is the slower mode overall, and that the model fares best for developing countries. It is worth mentioning that these findings are based on the assumption of temporal and monetary expenses being the only determining factor in mode-choice.},

Our (feeling of ) connectedness also matters for the efficacy and functioning of communities and societies as a whole. Different mobility practices offer different conditions for being exposed to other people and the environment. Such exposure influences a sense of being connected to places, communities and societies. In transport planning practice and research, these relations are slowly getting attention. In this paper, we develop an analytical framework that offers a comprehensive understanding on if and how one's experiences of being on the move influence the ability of an individual to develop a sense of connectedness. We develop hypotheses about these possible relations, that link literatures from mobilities research and sociology to advance transport planning research and practice. First, we discuss how the experiences of being mobile using different transport modes set different stages for the potential exposure to a diversity of socio-spatial environments. Second, we translate this into an analytical framework for understanding the relationships between connectedness and using different mobility modes. In the final part of the paper, we illustrate this by operationalising a number of potential indicators of connectedness (as dependent variables).},

However, depicting OD data often encounter issues of cluttering and occlusion. To address these issues, many visual designs feature data abstraction and visual abstraction, such as node aggregation and edge bundling, resulting in information loss. The recent theoretical and empirical developments in visualization have substantiated the merits of such abstraction, while confirming that viewers' knowledge can alleviate the negative impact due to information loss. It is thus desirable to map out different ways of ``losing information'' in origin-destination data visualization (ODDV). We therefore outline a new design space of ODDV based on the categorization of informative operations on OD data in data abstraction and visual abstraction.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Widely varying crash circumstances have been reported for bicycling injuries, likely because of differing bicycling populations and environments. We used data from the Bicyclists' Injuries and the Cycling Environment Study in Vancouver and Toronto, Canada, to describe the crash circumstances of people injured while cycling for utilitarian and leisure purposes. We examined the association of crash circumstances with route type. METHODS: Adult cyclists injured and treated in a hospital emergency department described their crash circumstances. These were classified into major categories (collision vs. fall, motor vehicle involved vs. not) and subcategories. The distribution of circumstances was tallied for each of 14 route types defined in an earlier analysis. Ratios of observed vs. expected were tallied for each circumstance and route type combination. RESULTS: Of 690 crashes, 683 could be characterized for this analysis. Most (74\%) were collisions. Collisions included those with motor vehicles (34\%), streetcar (tram) or train tracks (14\%), other surface features (10\%), infrastructure (10\%), and pedestrians, cyclists, or animals (6\%). The remainder of the crashes were falls (26\%), many as a result of collision avoidance manoeuvres. Motor vehicles were involved directly or indirectly with 48\% of crashes. Crash circumstances were distributed differently by route type, for example, collisions with motor vehicles, including "doorings", were overrepresented on major streets with parked cars. Collisions involving streetcar tracks were overrepresented on major streets. Collisions involving infrastructure (curbs, posts, bollards, street furniture) were overrepresented on multiuse paths and bike paths. CONCLUSIONS: These data supplement our previous analyses of relative risks by route type by indicating the types of crashes that occur on each route type. This information can guide municipal engineers and planners towards improvements that would make cycling safer.},

  abstract = {The term ``safe space'' dates to the late twentieth century women's movement, but it has since been used in many different contexts. In this paper, we review and analyze historical and contemporary ``safe spaces''. These include ``separatist'' safe spaces in women's, anti-racist, and feminist communities, ``inclusive'' safe space classrooms, and safe spaces in which (non-human) objects are central. We argue that safe spaces should be understood not through static and acontextual notions of ``safe'' or ``unsafe'', but rather through the relational work of cultivating them. Such an understanding reveals several tendencies. Namely, safe spaces are inherently paradoxical. Cultivating them includes foregrounding social differences and binaries (safe\textendash unsafe, inclusive\textendash exclusive) as well as recognizing the porosity of such binaries. Renegotiating these binaries is necessarily incomplete; a safe space is never completely safe. Even so, we encourage the critical cultivation of safe space as a site for negotiating difference and challenging oppression.},

Embedding R into NetLogo allows the use of advanced statistical analyses, specific statistical distributions, and advanced tools for visualization from within NetLogo programs. Embedding NetLogo into R makes it possible to design simulation experiments and all settings for analysing model output from the outset, using R, and then embed NetLogo programs in this virtual laboratory.

So far, for comprehensive analyses of agent-based models (ABMs) implemented in NetLogo, results needed to be written to files and evaluated by using external software, for example R. Ideally, however, it would be possible to call any R function from within a NetLogo program. This would allow sophisticated interactive statistical analysis of model structure and dynamics, using R functions and packages for generating certain statistical distributions and experimental design, and for implementing complex descriptive submodels within ABMs. Here we present an R extension of NetLogo. It consists of only nine new NetLogo primitives for sending data between NetLogo and R and for calling R functions (six additional primitives for debugging). We demonstrate the usage of the R extension with three short examples. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In particular, the paper uses a method of sample weighting to compensate for potential biases related to unequal probabilities of selection. The findings suggest, however, that the unweighted commercial microdata can be used in migration modelling to give reassuringly reliable estimates of associational patterns of key demographic, socio-economic and behavioural/lifestyle characteristics.},

DESIGN: Web-based survey to establish a cohort of cyclists. SETTING: Participants in the largest mass-participation bicycle event in New Zealand, the Wattyl Lake Taupo Cycle Challenge. PARTICIPANTS: 2469 riders who had enrolled online in the 2006 Wattyl Lake Taupo Cycle Challenge. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported crashes in preceding 12 months. RESULTS: Of 5653 eligible riders, 2469 (44\%) completed the study questionnaire. Mean age was 44 years, 73\% were male, and the average number of kilometers cycled per week in the preceding 12 months was 130. The annual incidence of crashes leading to injury that disrupted usual daily activities for at least 24 h was 0.5 per cyclist/year. About one-third of these crashes resulted in presentation to a health professional. The mean number of days absent from work attributable to bicycle crashes was 0.39 per cyclist/year. After adjustment for potential confounders and exposure (kilometers cycled per year), the rate of days off work from bicycle crash injury was substantially lower among riders who reported always wearing fluorescent colors (multivariate incidence rate ratio 0.23, 95\% CI 0.09 to 0.59). CONCLUSIONS: Low cyclist conspicuity may increase the risk of crash-related injury and subsequent time off work. Increased use of high-visibility clothing is a simple intervention that may have a large impact on the safety of cycling.},

  abstract = {The most effective interventions By 23 February 2020, China had imposed a national emergency response to restrict travel and impose social distancing measures on its populace in an attempt to inhibit the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome\textendash coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, which measures were most effective is uncertain. Tian et al. performed a quantitative analysis of the impact of control measures between 31 December 2019 and 19 February 2020, which encompasses the Lunar New Year period when millions of people traveled across China for family visits. Travel restrictions in and out of Wuhan were too late to prevent the spread of the virus to 262 cities within 28 days. However, the epidemic peaked in Hubei province on 4 February 2020, indicating that measures such as closing citywide public transport and entertainment venues and banning public gatherings combined to avert hundreds of thousands of cases of infection. It is unlikely that this decline happened because the supply of susceptible people was exhausted, so relaxing control measures could lead to a resurgence. Science, this issue p. 638 Responding to an outbreak of a novel coronavirus [agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] in December 2019, China banned travel to and from Wuhan city on 23 January 2020 and implemented a national emergency response. We investigated the spread and control of COVID-19 using a data set that included case reports, human movement, and public health interventions. The Wuhan shutdown was associated with the delayed arrival of COVID-19 in other cities by 2.91 days. Cities that implemented control measures preemptively reported fewer cases on average (13.0) in the first week of their outbreaks compared with cities that started control later (20.6). Suspending intracity public transport, closing entertainment venues, and banning public gatherings were associated with reductions in case incidence. The national emergency response appears to have delayed the growth and limited the size of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, averting hundreds of thousands of cases by 19 February (day 50). Travel restrictions and the national emergency response delayed the growth and limited the size of the COVID-19 epidemic in China.

  abstract = {Walking and cycling can make a considerable contribution to sustainable transport goals, building healthier and more sustainable communities and contributing to traffic and pollution reduction. There have been many national and local initiatives to promote walking and cycling, but without a long term vision and consistent strategy it is difficult to see how a significant change may be achieved. This paper presents three alternative visions for the role of walking and cycling in urban areas for the year 2030: each vision illustrates a 'desirable' walking- and cycling-oriented transport system against a different 'exogenous social background'. These visions have been developed through a process of expert discussion and review and are intended to provide a stimulus for debate on the potential for and desirability of such alternative futures. Each is based on the UK and represents a substantial change to the current situation: in particular, each of the visions presents a view of a society where walking and cycling are considerably more important than is currently the case and where these modes cater for a much higher proportion of urban transport needs than at present. The visions show pictures of urban environments where dependence on motor vehicles has been reduced, in two of the visions to very low levels. The methodological approach for devising visions is informed by work on 'utopian thinking': a key concept underlying this approach is one of viewing the future in social constructivist terms (i.e. the future is what 'we', as a society, make it) rather than considering the future as something that can be 'scientifically' predicted by the extrapolation of current trends. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Although the ecological world is unavoidably spatial, there have been few attempts to determine how explicit considerations of space may alter the predictions of ecological models, or what insights it may give into the causes of broad-scale ecological patterns. As this book demonstrates, the spatial structure of a habitat can fundamentally alter both the qualitative and quantitative dynamics and outcomes of ecological processes.Spatial Ecology highlights the importance of space to five topical areas: stability, patterns of diversity, invasions, coexistence, and pattern generation. It illustrates both the diversity of approaches used to study spatial ecology and the underlying similarities of these approaches. Over twenty contributors address issues ranging from the persistence of endangered species, to the maintenance of biodiversity, to the dynamics of hosts and their parasitoids, to disease dynamics, multispecies competition, population genetics, and fundamental processes relevant to all these cases. There have been many recent advances in our understanding of the influence of spatially explicit processes on individual species and on multispecies communities. This book synthesizes these advances, shows the limitations of traditional, non-spatial approaches, and offers a variety of new approaches to spatial ecology that should stimulate ecological research.},

  abstract = {Over the past fifty years a growing body of work has sought to address the problem of planning for transportation in the long-term future through scenario building. Such thinking has generally been restricted to issues concerned with environmental sustainability and the 'images' of future transport so created are usually weak in terms of their social sustainability content, either treating social issues superficially, or ignoring them entirely, or even creating images that are socially undesirable. At the same time, there has generally been a marked decrease over the past twenty years in socially oriented utopian thinking. As a direct result of these two factors, hardly any consideration has been given recently to imagining socially sustainable views of transport in a future utopia. The key underlying aim of this paper is to provide some background thinking about how this lack might be addressed. To do so, it examines concepts about utopia in terms of their form, content, and function, and considers possible reasons for the recent decline in utopian thinking and their 'replacement' by a type of futures-thinking that is referred to as dystopian avoidance. It then examines transport characteristics of utopian thinking in urban planning in the 20th century and considers various 'antinomies of transport' with respect to future utopias. Based upon the insights gained, the paper comments on two existing 'practical' sets of transport-related scenarios in terms of their utopian and dystopian characteristics. One particular result is that the utopian aspects of these scenario sets in terms of their social content are relatively weak, in line with the hypothesised recent general decline in (social) utopian thinking. Various conclusions are made which emphasise the usefulness of utopian thinking in transport planning, particularly in participatory approaches. It is suggested that three elements of the transport system should be separately 'utopianised': the mobility of people and goods; physical aspects that facilitate or inhibit such mobility; and the system of governance with respect to formulating and implementing transport policy.},

  abstract = {Background: Active commuting increases levels of physical activity and is more likely to be adopted and sustained than exercise programmes. Despite the potential health, environmental, social and economic benefits, cycling and walking are increasingly marginal modes of transport in many countries. This paper investigated regional and individual differences in cycling and walking to work in New Zealand over the 15-year period (1991-2006). Methods: New Zealand Census data (collected every five years) were accessed to analyse selfreported information on the "main means of travel to work" from individuals aged 15 years and over who are usually resident and employed in New Zealand. This analysis investigated differences in patterns of active commuting to work stratified by region, age, gender and personal income. Results: In 2006, over four-fifths of New Zealanders used a private vehicle, one in fourteen walked and one in forty cycled to work. Increased car use from 1991 to 2006 occurred at the expense of active means of travel as trends in public transport use remained unchanged during that period. Of the 16 regions defined at meshblock and area unit level, Auckland had the lowest prevalence of cycling and walking. In contrast to other regions, walking to work increased in Wellington and Nelson, two regions which have made substantial investments in local infrastructure to promote active transport. Nationally, cycling prevalence declined with age whereas a U-shaped trend was observed for walking. The numbers of younger people cycling to work and older people walking to work declined substantially from 1991 to 2006. Higher proportions of men compared with women cycled to work. The opposite was true for walking with an increasing trend observed in women aged under 30 years. Walking to work was less prevalent among people with higher income. Conclusion: We observed a steady decline in cycling and walking to work from 1991 to 2006, with two regional exceptions. This together with the important differences in travel patterns by age, gender and personal income highlights opportunities to target and modify transport policies in order to promote active commuting.},

  abstract = {The emphasis in transportation planning has recently changed from long-range, high-capital investments to short-term, low-cost transportation system improvements. The development of incentives for bus riding and carpooling, particularly for the work trip, plays a major role in this resource management process. This study is specifically designed to uncover factors which influence the intentions of the single-occupant auto commuters to switch to buses and carpools and to suggest operating policies consistent with the intent to encourage the use of high-occupancy vehicles. The single-occupant auto commuters are segmented into several potential ridesharing markets on the basis of their expressed intention to take a bus or a carpool if certain transportation system modifications were effected. Three groups of switchers are identified: those who are positively oriented towards taking a bus, those who would only switch to a carpool, and those who would consider either of the ridesharing modes. Bus convenience is the most important variable associated with the shift intention. Perceptions of carpool comfort do not appear to be important, rather, perceptions of carpool schedule flexibility, cost, safety and a short wait in traffic are prime factors associated with potential carpool shifting. Additional models involving mode satisfaction are reviewed and policies which enhance bus convenience and minimize waiting in traffic for carpools are suggested to recruit the potential ridesharers.},

  abstract = {Interest into active modes (i.e. walking and cycling) has increased significantly over the past decades, with governments worldwide ultimately aiming for a modal shift towards active modes. To devise policies that promote this goal, understanding the determinants that influence the choice for an active mode is essential. The Netherlands is country with a large and demographically diverse active mode user population, mature and complete active mode infrastructure, and safe environment. Mode choice research from the Netherlands enables a comparison on relevant determinants with countries that have a low active mode share. Furthermore, it can provide quantitative input for policies aiming at an active mode shift. This paper estimates a mode choice model focusing on active modes, while including a more comprehensive set of modes (i.e. walking, cycling, public transport and car). Based on data from the Netherlands Mobility Panel (MPN) in combination with an additional survey focused on active modes (coined PAW-AM), this study estimates which determinants influence mode choice. The determinants can be categorized as individual characteristics, household characteristics, season and weather characteristics, trip characteristics, built environment, and work conditions. The results show that all categories of determinants influence both walking and cycling. However, the choice for cycling or walking is affected by different determinants and to a different extent. In addition, no active mode nest was found in the model estimation. Cycling and walking should thus be regarded as two distinguished alternatives. Furthermore, the results show that active mode use is most sensitive to changes in the trip characteristics and the built environment.},

It constitutes an arena for early dialogue between main actors and stakeholders at local, regional and national level to jointly assess transport related problems and develop solutions. This paper explores the collaborative elements of this planning method, analysing the extent to which the introduction of SCM implies fundamental steps towards a planning approach based on communicative rationality in Swedish national transport planning. The article departs from the government's recognition of the need for more and deeper collaboration between actors, new approaches and measures for transport problem, and increasing attention to demand management and modal shift to meet transport policy goals more efficiently, asking whether SCM makes national transport planning in Sweden more collaborative, in the sense of primarily relying on communicative rationality. The focus of the analysis lies on collaborative elements in the official SCM guidelines produced by the Swedish Transport Administration (STA) as an expression of an ``ideal'' SCM process, and a case study of an SCM process considered by the STA to be a good example of SCM in practice. The article concludes that although traces of communicative rationality are visible in both ``ideal'' and in practice, a more fundamental shift from instrumental to communicative rationality in Swedish national transport planning through the introduction of SCM has not occurred, since collaborative practices of SCM mainly are framed in a wider institutional framework of instrumental rationality.},

We compared participants from the Ciclovia (streets temporarily closed to motorized vehicles and open for pedestrians) and Cicloruta (bicycle paths) programs in Bogota\textasciiacute{} , Colombia, to assess associations of program participation with physical activity, safety, social capital, and equity. Methods. We conducted 2 cross-sectional studies in October 2009 with intercept surveys: one among 1000 Ciclovia participants and the other among 1000 Cicloruta participants. Results. Most Ciclovia participants met the physical activity recommendation in leisure time (59.5\%), and most Cicloruta participants met it by cycling for transportation (70.5\%). Ciclovia participants reported a higher perception of safety (51.2\% regarding traffic and 42.4\% about crime) and social capital (odds ratio = 2.0; 95\% confidence interval = 1.4, 2.8) than did Cicloruta users. Most Cicloruta users reported living in low socioeconomic status categories (53.1\%), had lower educational attainment (27\%), and did not own cars (82.9\%). Most Ciclovia participants reported living in middle socioeconomic status categories (64\%), had low-to-middle educational attainment (51.1\%), and did not own cars (66.1\%). Conclusions. The Ciclovia and Cicloruta programs have the potential to equitably promote physical activity and provide a mobility alternative in complex urban settings such as Bogota\textasciiacute{} .

We use a computable general equilibrium model to study the effects of including the transport sector in the EU's emissions trading scheme under three future oil price scenarios. Our results show that there are potentially significant welfare gains from including transportation in the emissions trading scheme because the system as a whole helps absorb required changes in climate policy to meet the overall EU cap on emissions. There is, however, a cost in terms of somewhat greater permit price uncertainty.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The first line of argument is to do with the extremely high capital cost of the supply system that would be required, and the second is to do with the problems set by the intermittency of renewable sources. It is concluded that the general climate change and energy problem cannot be solved without large scale reductions in rates of economic production and consumption, and therefore without transition to fundamentally different social structures and systems.},

In 1991 there were two SAR files: a household file and an individual file.

The paper puts forward the case for an additional sample of microdata, also drawn from the census, that has much greater geographical detail. Small area microdata (SAM) are individual level records with local area identifiers and, to maintain confidentiality, reduced detail on the census variables. Population data from seven local authorities, including rural and urban areas, are used to define prototype samples of SAM. The rationale for SAM is given, with examples that demonstrate the role of local area information in the analysis of census data. Since there is a trade-off between the extent of local detail and the extent of detail on variables that can be made available, the confidentiality risk of SAM is assessed empirically. An indicative specification of the SAM is given, having taken into account the results of the confidentiality analysis.},

  abstract = {Recent work in the field of management has focused on 'dynamic capability', the ability of a firm to develop new capabilities in response to shifts in its external environment, as a significant source of competitive advantage. This paper enhances our understanding of dynamic technical capability. While most established firms have difficulty adapting when confronted with radical, competence-destroying technological change, Mergenthaler Linotype, a firm founded in 1886, has survived three such revolutions and led the market in 1990. An examination of the history of this firm in contrast to other incumbents from the same era highlights two key contributors to dynamic technical capability: external integrative capability and geographically distributed research sites. External integrative capability comprises two elements: internal investments that develop absorptive capacity and an external communication infrastructure to facilitate the transmission of external knowledge. In combination, these elements enable the firm successfully to identify and integrate knowledge outside its boundaries. Geographically distributed research sites facilitate the development of new technical capability in three ways. First, competition among research sites spurs innovation. Second, multiple locations help to overcome organizational inertia by alloiving for the development of different generations of technology in different locations. Finally, multiple locations provide a source of variation, enabling the firm to leverage differences in local environments.},

  abstract = {Background. Promotion of transportation-related physical activity is consistent with current national recommendations. However, few studies have simultaneously examined correlates of recreational and transportation physical activity. Methods. Surveys were mailed to 1002 adults residing in a Massachusetts suburb. The survey included measures of self-reported recreational and transportation-related physical activity and demographic, cognitive, interpersonal, and environmental variables potentially correlated with activity. Multiple linear regression was used to examine the associations between environmental variables and the two outcomes. Results. Respondents (n ϭ 413) who averaged 51.2 Ϯ 16.8 years of age reported 132.3 Ϯ 140.5 min/week recreational physical activity and 142.1 Ϯ 180.9 min/week transportation activity. Sidewalks (P ϭ 0.02) and traffic (P ϭ 0.01) were each associated with higher levels of recreational physical activity in unadjusted analyses, but in models that controlled for age, self-efficacy for physical activity and family social support for physical activity, these environmental variables were nonsignificant. Three perceived environmental variables (enjoyable scenery, sidewalks, traffic) and one objective environmental variable (distance from home to a community rail-trail) each showed associations (P Յ 0.05) with transportation-related physical activity in models that controlled for age and self-efficacy. Conclusions. Neighborhood physical environmental variables were associated with transportation physical activity, but not with recreational physical activity. Further research is needed to identify shared and unique correlates of recreational and transportation physical activity in urban, suburban, and rural settings.},

The construction of bicycle lane networks has been identified as an effective tool for increasing citizen's mobility and accessibility as well as combating the effects of motorization, but in cities where bicycle lane networks exist, it is not known if they have benefited different income groups equally. This paper assesses the extent to which bicycle lane provisioning has been equitable among neighborhoods in Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba. Both cities were found to have more than twice the supply of bicycle lanes in the wealthiest quintile than the lowest income quintile relative to area and population. A network analysis using a Level of Traffic Stress classification to categorize roads found that wealthier areas have more commercial areas accessible along safer cycling routes. Implications for cycling policy and future research are discussed.},

As resources, rather than responsibilities, children fetch and carry, and attend school in shifts. From a transport activity or survival network approach, these elements can be viewed as key strategies in the organization of travel and transport.},

We investigated this issue using data from the HABITAT study of physical activity among 11,037 mid-aged residents of 200 neighbourhoods in Brisbane, Australia. Using a five-step mediation analysis and multilevel regression, we found that higher levels of walking for transport in disadvantaged neighbourhoods was associated with living in a built environment more conducive to walking (i.e. greater street connectivity and land use mix) and residents of these neighbourhoods having more limited access to a motor vehicle. The health benefits that accrue to residents of disadvantaged neighbourhoods as a result of their higher levels of walking for transport might help offset the negative effects of less healthy behaviours (e.g. smoking, poor diet), thus serving to contain or reduce neighbourhood inequalities in chronic disease.},

  abstract = {To curtail the rising numbers of cyclists seriously injured in road crashes, more insights are needed into the factors that contribute to these crashes. For instance, darkness is known to be associated with higher injury rates, but little is known about the relative influence of factors such as poor conspicuity, impaired perception and alcohol use among cyclists. To examine these factors, the present study analyzed the epidemiological crash data for three meteorological light conditions: daylight, late evening darkness and early morning darkness; for two crash types: crashes with (M-crashes) and without motorized traffic (NM-crashes); and for different age groups. The relative injury rates (injury risk per distance travelled in darkness corrected for daylight injury risks for each age group) confirmed findings from earlier studies that cycling in late evening darkness is associated with higher injury rates than cycling in daylight conditions. This is the case for both crash types with only small differences between the age groups suggesting that poor conspicuity (M-crashes) and impaired perception (NM-crashes) may play a role. In comparison to late evening darkness, relative injury rates in early morning darkness are much higher. This is the case for both crash types with large differences among the age groups, suggesting that in addition to the absence of daylight also age related risk factors are at play. Support for this hypothesis was found from the analyses of hospital records, showing that the proportion of seriously injured cyclists who have been drinking is highest in early morning darkness and has strongly increased over the last decades. These insights provide input for the selection of countermeasures such as improved lighting (both street and bicycle lights) and interventions targeting alcohol use among cyclists.},

Methods Probit and structural equation models have been estimated, while additional statistical analysis was performed to gain better insight of the commuters' mobility behavior. Results The analysis showed that the main factor affecting the preference of commuters toward passenger car is the availability of parking space. A preference of female respondents towards public transport was also evident, while, compared to the other age groups, respondents between the ages of 35 and 44 show a higher preference for car. Furthermore, crowding is the factor that most discourages respondents from the use of public transport. High fare, lack of public transport information and bad accessibility to the transit network do not seem to discourage respondents' use of public transport in the particular situation that was analyzed in this research. Conclusions The paper demonstrated how the results drawn from the analysis can be used for tactical and strategic planning. For example, the fact that high fare levels do not discourage commuters from using public transport, may allow policy makers to slightly increase fares and redirect additional revenue to improve other public transport services. Therefore, such findings may be quite useful for policy makers to better tackle commuters' perception and to define the appropriate urban mobility management actions and policies.},

It is asserted that this condition, termed carbon lock-in, creates persistent market and policy failures that can inhibit the diffusion of carbon-saving technologies despite their apparent environmental and economic advantages. The notion of a Techno-Institutional Complex is introduced to capture the idea that lock-in occurs through combined interactions among technological systems and governing institutions. While carbon lock-in provides a conceptual basis for understanding macro-level barriers to the diffusion of carbon-saving technologies, it also generates questions for standard economic modeling approaches that abstract away technological and institutional evolution in their elaboration. The question of escaping carbon lock-in is left for a future paper.},

  abstract = {Cycling has a range of health, environmental and economic benefits compared with motorised forms of transport. There is a need to encourage more cycling, yet previous evaluations of cycling promotion schemes have been inconclusive about what works. A case study of a cycling promotion scheme at the University of Sheffield \textendash{} the Cycle Challenge \textendash{} is used in this paper to examine commuting behaviour and long-term behavioural shifts towards cycling in response to outside intervention at the organisational level. The Cycle Challenge was designed to encourage more people at the University to cycle through inter-departmental competition. Cycling behaviour was recorded before the Cycle Challenge and two years after the scheme's completion. It was found that seventy five percent of participants who were not already regular cyclists reported increased cycling, yet the overall impact of this shift was limited because the majority of participants already cycled regularly. This failure to attract new cyclists suggests recruiting non-cyclists should be a priority in future schemes. Moreover, our study has methodological implications. Current strategies for evaluating the positive impact of cycle initiatives may overestimate the savings by neglecting the tendency of people to resume routine behaviour in the long run. Studies evaluating modal shift should therefore include provision for monitoring long-term behavioural change to provide input into estimated economic, environmental or health metrics of success.},

Darkness acts as a barrier to people cycling, with fewer people cycling after-dark when seasonal and time-of-day factors are accounted for. This paper explores whether road lighting can reduce the negative impact of darkness on cycling rates. Changes in cycling rates between daylight and after-dark were quantified for 48 locations in Birmingham, United Kingdom, by calculating an odds ratio. These odds ratios were compared against two measures of road lighting at each location: 1) Density of road lighting lanterns; 2) Relative brightness as estimated from night-time aerial images. Locations with no road lighting showed a significantly greater reduction in cycling after-dark compared with locations that had some lighting. A nonlinear relationship was found between relative brightness at a location at night and the reduction in cyclists after-dark. Small initial increases in brightness resulted in large reductions in the difference between cyclist numbers in daylight and after-dark, but this effect reached a plateau as brightness increased. These results suggest only a minimal amount of lighting can promote cycling after-dark, making it an attractive mode of transport year-round.},

While active travel has been shown to be associated with features of the built environment such as density and land-use mix, it is also associated with walking and cycling accessibility\textemdash which we designate as active accessibility. However, the measurement of active accessibility is not straightforward and it can represent significantly different features of the built environment. This paper presents an extensive review of published research that measures active accessibility. We classified the literature into four categories based on the methodology used: distance-based, gravity-based or potential, topological or infrastructure-based, and walkability and walk score-type measures. A fifth category was created to classify outliers consisting of distinct methodological approaches or hybrids of the four main categories. We argue that almost all of these methods have conceptual and computational limitations, and that there are inconsistencies in the use of concepts and terms. Furthermore, no sensitivity analysis was carried out on the selected parameters. We conclude by presenting some guidelines that might improve the value and clarity of active accessibility research, theory, and practice.},

  abstract = {Wind power has a significant contribution to make in efforts to abate CO2 emissions from global energy systems. Currently, wind power generation costs are approaching parity with costs attributed to conventional, carbon-based sources of energy but the economic advantage still rests decidedly with conventional sources. Therefore, there is an imperative to ensure that wind power projects are developed in the most economically optimal fashion. For wind power project developers, shaving a few tenths of a cent off of the kilowatts per hour cost of wind power can mean the difference between a commercially viable project and a non-starter. For civic authorities who are responsible for managing municipally supported wind power projects, optimizing the economics of such projects can attenuate stakeholder opposition. This paper attempts to contribute to a better understanding of how to economically optimise wind power projects by conflating research from the fields of energy economics, wind power engineering, aerodynamics, geography and climate science to identify critical factors that influence the economic optimization of wind power projects.},

Methods:\hspace{0.6em} Data from participants (32\textendash 82 years) of the 2011 survey of the Dutch population-based GLOBE study were used (N = 2375). Highest attained educational level (independent variable) and walking for transport, cycling for transport, walking in leisure time and cycling in leisure time (dependent variables) were self-reported in the survey. GIS-systems were used to obtain spatial data on residential built environment characteristics. A four-step mediationbased analysis with log-linear regression models was used to examine to contribution of the residential built environment to educational inequalities in walking and cycling. Results:\hspace{0.6em} As compared to the lowest educational group, the highest educational group was more likely to cycle for transport (RR 1.13, 95\% CI 1.04\textendash 1.23), walk in leisure time (RR 1.12, 95\% CI 1.04\textendash 1.21), and cycle in leisure time (RR 1.12, 95\% CI 1.03\textendash 1.22). Objective built environment characteristics were related to these outcomes, but contributed minimally to educational inequalities in walking and cycling. On the other hand, compared to the lowest educational group, the highest educational group was less likely to walk for transport (RR 0.91, 95\% CI 0.82\textendash 1.01), which could partly be attributed to differences in the built environment. Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} This study found that objective built environment characteristics contributed minimally to educational inequalities in walking and cycling in the Netherlands.},

Convinced of its potential, we want to show how Luhmann's systems theory offers fresh insight into both limits and possibilities of planning in contemporary society. We argue that Luhmann's understanding of society as functionally differentiated into self-referentially closed subsystems (politics, economy, law, science, etc.) creates space for a complex and subtle analysis of planning practice. In particular, we look at the role of planning within an autopoietic account of society, and its ability to steer other social subsystems. Planning is seen as the form of steering aiming to coordinate processes of spatial organization, therefore an activity dealing with steering problems. We illustrate key concepts of the systems theory in brief analyses of planning situations and interpret these situations using the systems theoretical framework. The analyses center around the questions of planning's steering capacity and the role of the planner, thus creating linkages with mainstream discussions in planning theory.},

A clustering method is applied. It is shown that in a highly urbanised country, the situation is far from being spatially equitable in terms of accessibility, and some areas are more favoured than others. Congestion increases spatial inequalities, differently according to absolute or relative measures of change. By means of examples, this paper shows that even simple accessibility indicators could be useful to support decisions taken by planners and politicians (e.g. as regards the development of residential, industrial and business park areas). Maps indicate the spatial inequalities in terms of accessibility to urban centres and transport nodes, and the impact of congestion on these inequalities. The absolute and relative time losses due to congestion affect different areas in different ways. The location of new developments further increases the congestion problem and the spatial disparities. This paper also insists on the caution that should be adopted when measuring and interpreting ``accessibility'', its measurements, its inputs, its temporal changes in absolute and relative terms as well as the need for spatially disaggregated data.},

Control sites are sampled along the 'bikeable' road network in function of the potential bicycle traffic transiting in each ward. Risk factors are limited to infrastructure, traffic and environmental characteristics. Results suggest that a high risk is statistically associated with the presence of on-road tram tracks, bridges without cycling facility, complex intersections, proximity to shopping centres or garages, and busy van and truck traffic. Cycle facilities built at intersections and parked vehicles located next to separated cycle facilities are also associated with an increased risk, whereas contraflow cycling is associated with a reduced risk. The cycling accident risk is far from being negligible in points where there is actually no reported cycling accident but where they are yet expected to occur. Hence, mapping predicted accident risks provides planners and policy makers with a useful tool for accurately locating places with a high potential risk even before accidents actually happen. This also provides comprehensible information for orienting cyclists to the safest routes in Brussels.},

  abstract = {In The Netherlands, on bicycle paths, single-bicycle accidents, bicycle-bicycle and bicycle-moped accidents constitute a considerable share of all bicyclist injuries. Over three quarters of all hospitalised bicyclist victims in the Netherlands cannot be directly related to a crash with motorised traffic. As the usage of bicycle paths steadily increases, it is to be expected that safety on bicycle paths will become a major issue in the coming years in The Netherlands. A study was conducted into the behaviour of bicyclists and moped riders to improve traffic safety on bicycle paths. By behavioural observations with video, mutual conflicts and bicyclist behaviour on bicycle paths were recorded and analysed, among other things by means of the conflict observation method DOCTOR (Dutch Objective Conflict Technique for Operation and Research). The explorative phase of the study (phase 1), included two research locations, one in the city of Amsterdam and one in Eindhoven. The results gave guidance for a better understanding of the behaviour between different users of separate two-directional bicycle paths. An example includes the relationship between bicyclist-moped rider behaviour and the width of the bicycle path. For a condition with busy bicycle traffic in both directions the width of the bicycle path in Amsterdam (effectively 3.55m) is relatively narrow, whereas the bicycle path width in Eindhoven ({$>$}4.94m) appears to be sufficient to accommodate large flows of bicyclists. Because of a large flow of crossing pedestrians resulting in (severe) conflicts with bicyclists in Amsterdam, additional countermeasures to better control these interactions are needed. The DOCTOR conflict observation method from video appears to be applicable for conflicts between intersecting road users and for head-on conflicts on the bicycle path. Conflict situations between bicyclists in the same direction (constituting an important share of injury accidents on bicycle paths) require an additional and more general systematic observation of specific behaviour. Therefore, phase 2 of the project will focus in particular on interactions between bicycle path users in the same direction and underlying processes.},

But the true story of what happened is almost entirely unknown - not least because so much of the EU's real business takes place behind closed doors. In this fearless account, Varoufakis reveals all: an extraordinary tale of brinkmanship, hypocrisy, collusion and betrayal that will shake the deep establishment to its foundations.As is now clear, the same policies that required the tragic and brutal suppression of Greece's democratic uprising have led directly to authoritarianism, populist revolt and instability throughout the Western world.Adults In The Room is an urgent wake-up call to renew European democracy before it is too late --},

The focus is on vertical equity, i.e. whether BRT systems achieve progressive benefits for poorer segments of the population. Findings from Africa, Asia, and Latin America all suggest that BRT does offer significant benefits to low-income groups, in terms of travel time and cost savings, access enhancement, and safety and health benefits. However benefits are often skewed toward medium-income users and thus less progressive than they might be. Two primary reasons for this are insufficient spatial coverage and inappropriate fare policies. While many features of BRT potentially allow it to deliver pro-poor outcomes, such outcomes only materialize if BRT implementers pay specific and sustained attention to equity. The paper identifies key issues that need to be addressed to steer BRT implementation toward more socially sustainable outcomes\textemdash including better integration with other transit, paratransit, and nonmotorized transport services, and with the housing sector.},

If this intervention had not taken place, it would still be there and so if left, the grassland vegetation and fields we see today would revert to its natural closed forest state, although with a reduced number of wild species. This book challenges this view, using examples from history, pollen analyses and studies on the ecology of tree and shrub species such as oak and hazel. It tests the hypotheses that the climax vegetation is a closed canopy forest against the alternative one in which species composition and succession of vegetation were governed by herbivores and that the Central and Western European lowlands were covered by a park-like landscape consisting of grasslands, scrub, solitary trees and groves bordered by a mantle and fringe vegetation. Comparative information from North America is also included, because the forests there are commonly regarded as being analogous to the primeval vegetation in Europe.

  abstract = {To study the speed choice and mental workload of elderly cyclists on electrical assisted bicycles (e-bikes) in simple and complex traffic situations compared to these on conventional bicycles, a field experiment was conducted using two instrumented bicycles. These bicycles were identical except for the electric pedal support system. Two groups were compared: elderly cyclists (65 years of age and older) and a reference group of cyclists in middle adulthood (between 30 and 45 years of age). Participants rode a fixed route with a length of approximately 3.5 km on both bicycles in counterbalanced order. The route consisted of secluded bicycle paths and roads in a residential area where cyclist have to share the road with motorized traffic. The straight sections on secluded bicycle paths were classified as simple traffic situations and the intersections in the residential area where participants had to turn left, as complex traffic situations. Speed and mental workload were measured. For the assessment of mental workload the peripheral detection task (PDT) was applied. In simple traffic situations the elderly cyclists rode an average 3.6 km/h faster on the e-bike than on the conventional bicycle. However, in complex traffic situations they rode an average only 1.7 km/h faster on the e-bike than on the conventional bicycle. Except for the fact that the cyclists in middle adulthood rode an average approximately 2.6 km/h faster on both bicycle types and in both traffic conditions, their speed patterns were very similar. The speed of the elderly cyclists on an e-bike was approximately the speed of the cyclists in middle adulthood on a conventional bicycle. For the elderly cyclist and the cyclists in middle adulthood, mental workload did not differ between bicycle type. For both groups, the mental workload was higher in complex traffic situations than in simple traffic situations. Mental workload of the elderly cyclists was somewhat higher than the mental workload of the cyclists in middle adulthood. The relatively high speed of the elderly cyclists on e-bikes in complex traffic situations and their relatively high mental workload in these situations may increase the accident risk of elderly cyclist when they ride on an e-bike.},

  abstract = {Interest in producing ethanol from biomass in an attempt to make transportation ecologically sustainable continues to grow. In recent years, a large number of assessments have been conducted to assess the environmental merit of biofuels. Two detailed reviews present contrasting results: one is generally unfavourable, whilst the other is more favourable towards fuel bio-ethanol. However, most work that has been done so far, to assess the conversion of specific feedstocks to biofuels, specifically bio-ethanol, has not gone beyond energy and carbon assessments. This study draws on 47 published assessments that compare bio-ethanol systems to conventional fuel on a life cycle basis, or using life cycle assessment (LCA). A majority of these assessments focused on net energy and greenhouse gases, and despite differing assumptions and system boundaries, the following general lessons emerge: (i) make ethanol from sugar crops, in tropical countries, but approach expansion of agricultural land usage with extreme caution; (ii) consider hydrolysing and fermenting lignocellulosic residues to ethanol; and (iii) the LCA results on grasses as feedstock are insufficient to draw conclusions. It appears that technology choices in process residue handling and in fuel combustion are key, whilst site-specific environmental management tools should best handle biodiversity issues. Seven of the reviewed studies evaluated a wider range of environmental impacts, including resource depletion, global warming, ozone depletion, acidification, eutrophication, human and ecological health, smog formation, etc., but came up with divergent conclusions, possibly due to different approaches in scoping. These LCAs typically report that bio-ethanol results in reductions in resource use and global warming; however, impacts on acidification, human toxicity and ecological toxicity, occurring mainly during the growing and processing of biomass, were more often unfavourable than favourable. It is in this area that further work is needed.},

  abstract = {The use of bicycle is substantially affected by the weather patterns, which is expected to change in the future as a result of climate change. It is therefore important to understand the resulting potential changes in bicycle flows in order to accommodate adaptation planning for cycling. We propose a framework to model the changes in bicycle flow in London by developing a negative binomial count-data model and by incorporating future projected weather data from downscaled global climate models, a first such approach in this area. High temporal resolution (hourly) of our model allows us to decipher changes not only on an annual basis, but also on a seasonal and daily basis. We find that there will be a modest 0.5\% increase in the average annual hourly bicycle flows in London's network due to a changed climate. The increase is primarily driven by a higher temperature due to a changed climate, although the increase is tempered due to a higher rainfall. The annual average masks the differences of impacts between seasons though - bicycle flows are expected to increase during the summer and winter months (by 1.6\%), decrease during the spring (by 2\%) and remain nearly unchanged during the autumn. Leisure cycling will be more affected by a changed climate, with an increase of around 7\% during the weekend and holiday cycle flows in the summer months. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Local governments are central to the delivery of action on both decarbonisation and adapting to the risks of climate change. Yet there are likely to be significant differences across local governments in terms of their capacity to act on climate change. This research documents and explains differences in the capacity to act within response spaces to risks to transport infrastructure and systems. We examine 80 Transport Plans across local governments in England, specifically their efforts to incorporate climate change adaptation. Data are generated from content analysis of the 80 documents and key informant interviews in a sample of 15\% of authorities. The results show significant disparities across authorities. We explain differential outcomes as dependent on internal coordination, local prioritisation processes and political opposition. The results highlight that there are significant governance barriers associated with differential response capacity in the face of climate change risks.},

However, there has been relatively little examination of exactly which energy uses should be considered basic necessities within a given cultural context and so of concern for energy justice. We examine the inclusion of energy-using necessities within the outcomes of deliberative workshops within members of the public focused on defining a minimum-standard of living in the UK and repeated biannually over a six year period. Our secondary analysis shows that energy uses deemed to be necessities are diverse and plural, enabling access to multiple valued energy services, and that their profile has to some degree shifted from 2008 to 2014. The reasoning involved is multidimensional, ranging across questions of health, social participation, opportunity and practicality. We argue that public deliberations about necessities can be taken as legitimate grounding for defining minimum standards and therefore the scope of `doing justice' in fuel poverty policy. However we set this in tension with how change over time reveals the escalation of norms of energy dependency in a society that on climate justice grounds must radically reduce carbon emissions.},

Written for practicing public health researchers as well as graduate students in related fields, the text provides a thorough introduction to basic concepts and methods in applied spatial statistics as well as a detailed treatment of some of the more recent methods in spatial statistics useful for public health studies that have not been previously covered elsewhere. Assuming minimal knowledge of spatial statistics, the authors provide important statistical approaches for assessing such questions as: Are newly occurring cases of a disease "clustered" in space? Do the cases cluster around suspected sources of increased risk, such as toxic waste sites or other environmental hazards? How do we take monitored pollution concentrations measured at specific locations and interpolate them to locations where no measurements were taken? How do we quantify associations between local disease rates and local exposures? After reviewing traditional statistical methods used in public health research, the text provides an overview of the basic features of spatial data, illustrates various geographic mapping and visualization tools, and describes the sources of publicly available spatial data that might be useful in public health applications.},

Hypothesis building is based on a comparative, empirical research design, rather than on deductive theory construction. Potential critical success conditions are derived from literature. Based on five urban transport planning projects in Gothenburg (Sweden), London (United Kingdom), Milwaukee (United States), Tokyo (Japan) and Mexico City (Mexico), a rough set analysis of the five cases reveals validated success conditions, which can be used for formulating hypotheses for further research or for policy and process improvement. The results suggest that a dedicated management of the multi-actor network, a high diversity of actors, as well as an extensive use of knowledge integration methods in combination with a high network density are critical success conditions of these planning processes. Surprisingly, the extensive use of unilateral methods also showed to be an important success condition. The traditional role of the planner will have to be complemented with the expertise of network and methodology management. The authors conclude that rough set analysis can be a valuable addition to narrative, single-case analysis of collaborative urban transport planning processes.},

While many policy interventions have been made to promote cycling, not enough research has focused on the barriers to implementing pro-cycling policies. For effective policy implementation, identifying major barriers and removing them is critical. This study took an in-depth look at Hamburg which started a major cycling promotion in 2008. According to expert interviews and literature surveys, the author found that the major barriers are physical, political and institutional, and social and cultural. Specifically, the city lacks enough physical space, political support, and the evaluation of travel behavior and demand. Also, some private stakeholders are reluctant to give up on-street car parking space for cycling lanes, and the negotiation process is difficult and time-consuming. To overcome these barriers, Hamburg requires cycling-oriented urban design, a strategic and integrated cycling action plan, strong political support, and target group-oriented communication.},

  abstract = {Data and models of nonmotorized traffic on multiuse urban trails are needed to improve planning and management of urban transportation systems. Negative binomial regression models are appropriate and useful when dependent variables are nonnegative integers with overdispersion like traffic counts. This paper presents eight negative binomial models for estimating urban trail traffic using 1,898 daily mixed-mode traffic counts from active infrared monitors at six locations in Minneapolis, Minnesota. These models include up to 10 independent variables that represent sociodemographic, built environment, weather, and temporal characteristics. A general model can be used to estimate traffic at locations where traffic has not been monitored. A six-location model with dummy variables for each monitoring site rather than neighborhood-specific variables can be used to estimate traffic at existing locations when counts from monitors are not available. Six trail-specific models are appropriate for estimating variation in traffic in response to variations in weather and day of week. Validation results indicate that negative binomial models outperform models estimated by ordinary least squares regression. These new models estimate traffic within approximately 16.3\% error, on average, which is reasonable for planning and management purposes. \textcopyright{} 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Yet local authorities have been extremely active in promoting their role as local environmental guardians. In particular there has been a widespread emergence since the late 1980s of local environmental plans that attempt to highlight and co-ordinate local authorities' environmental roles. When the emergence of such documents is viewed in the context of agenda-setting theory, which examines how, why, when, and which issues come to receive consideration from decision-makers, and who is responsible for putting them on agendas, the evidence suggests that local environmental plans emerge from a myriad of often contradictory pressures. Local authorities are attempting to marry both their traditional compartmentalised approach to environmental problems with pressure from some environmental interest groups and internal policy activists, demanding a more holistic approach to newer global environmental issues. Moreover, at the same time central government is curbing local authorities' ability to act by fragmenting their power and imposing financial controls.},

Between 1980 and 2011, the cyclists' fatality rate declined by 67\% in the Netherlands and 57\% in the UK. Per capita bicycle use was sustained in the Netherlands throughout the post-World War Two era, peaking in the early 1960s and only declining for a decade before recovering. In contrast, UK bicycle use peaked in 1952 and declined permanently. The survival of popular bicycling in the Netherlands through the 1950s and 1960s was fundamental to the development of effective bicycling policies after the 1970s. The Dutch network of cycle tracks and routes increased from 9,000 km in the mid 1970s to approximately 29,000 km currently. The annual distance cycled per capita increased by 30\% in the ten years to 1988, but has not materially increased since then. In the UK, cycling has a long heritage as a marginalised form of travel. This continues to hinder efforts to achieve a national cycling revival. Nevertheless, cycling on quiet urban and rural roads in the UK incurs much lower risks than the national average fatality rate would suggest. Networks enabling cyclists to avoid main roads, especially rural A-roads, could provide safety levels comparable to the Netherlands and Denmark. There are towns in the UK with segregated cycling networks, but few cyclists. This is because a range of measures must be invoked to achieve large modal shifts to cycling. Local authority support is a critical factor.},

To do so I push existing applications of practice theories by outlining a 'systems of practice' approach, which articulates theories of practice with socio-technical systems approaches. After sketching out a theory of practice, I explore the potential of a practice theory approach to illuminate systemic change in transport. I do this by confronting two key criticisms of practice theories; first of their apparent difficulty in accounting for change; second of their limited demonstrated ability to move beyond a micro-level focus on doing. The counter I offer to these criticisms leads directly into recognising how theories of practice can articulate with socio-technical systems approaches. From this basis, I go on to consider the implications of a practice theory approach for informing interventions to effect a system transition towards decarbonised transport. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

These surveys provide decision markers with key measures of population demographics, health and nutrition, which allow informed policy evaluation to be made. Though standard health indicators are routinely published in survey final reports, much of the value of DHS is derived from the ability to download and analyse standardised microdata datasets for subgroup analysis, pooled multi-country analysis, and extended research studies. We have developed an open-source freely available R package `rdhs' to facilitate management and processing of DHS survey data. The package provides a suite of tools to (1) access standard survey indicators through the DHS Program API, (2) identify all survey datasets that include a particular topic or indicator relevant to a particular analysis, (3) directly download survey datasets from the DHS website, (4) load datasets and data dictionaries into R, and (5) extract variables and pool harmonised datasets for multi-survey analysis. We detail the core functionality of `rdhs' by demonstrating how the package can be used to firstly compare trends in the prevalence of anaemia among women between countries before conducting secondary analysis to assess for the relationship between education and anemia.},

This paper is based on peer-reviewed research which give some idea how to reduce the number of cyclist casualties. However, this research is rather limited and the results cannot (easily) be transferred from one setting or country to another: generalization of results should only be done with the utmost care, if it is to be done at all. Interventions to reduce cyclist casualties worldwide seem to be of an incidental nature; that is to say, they are implemented in a rather isolated way. In a Safe System approach, such as the Dutch Sustainable Safety vision, the inherent risks of traffic are dealt with in a systematic, proactive way. We illustrate how this approach is especially effective for vulnerable road users, such as cyclists. Finally, the paper addresses the question of whether it is possible to make more cycling good for road safety. We conclude that when the number of cyclists increases, the number of fatalities may increase, but will not necessarily do so, and the outcome is dependent on specific conditions. There is strong evidence that well-designed bicycle facilities-physically separated networks-reduce risks for cyclists, and therefore have an impact on the net safety result, for example if car-kilometres are substituted by bicycle kilometres. Policies to support cycling should incorporate these findings in order to make more cycling good for road safety.},

Poor access to opportunities and services offered by urban centres (a function of distance, transport infrastructure, and the spatial distribution of cities) is a major barrier to improved livelihoods and overall development. Advancing accessibility worldwide underpins the equity agenda of 'leaving no one behind' established by the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. This has renewed international efforts to accurately measure accessibility and generate a metric that can inform the design and implementation of development policies. The only previous attempt to reliably map accessibility worldwide, which was published nearly a decade ago, predated the baseline for the Sustainable Development Goals and excluded the recent expansion in infrastructure networks, particularly in lower-resource settings. In parallel, new data sources provided by Open Street Map and Google now capture transportation networks with unprecedented detail and precision. Here we develop and validate a map that quantifies travel time to cities for 2015 at a spatial resolution of approximately one by one kilometre by integrating ten global-scale surfaces that characterize factors affecting human movement rates and 13,840 high-density urban centres within an established geospatial-modelling framework. Our results highlight disparities in accessibility relative to wealth as 50.9\% of individuals living in low-income settings (concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa) reside within an hour of a city compared to 90.7\% of individuals in high-income settings. By further triangulating this map against socioeconomic datasets, we demonstrate how access to urban centres stratifies the economic, educational, and health status of humanity.},

The paper argues that cars as cultural objects have shifted from embodying the ideological philosophy of personal freedom to that of cocooning. In so doing the paper seeks to inject a note of caution into the debate over emergent post-automobility societies through reflection on the character and impact of cultures of automobility. Despite the possible declining functionality of cars as a means of transport, it is concluded that their appeal as personal space remains and may even be enhanced by future technological changes.},

  abstract = {The objective of this systematic review of observational studies was to gain insight into potential determinants of various types and intensities of physical activity among adult men and women. Studies were retrieved from Medline, PsycInfo, Embase and Social scisearch. The ANGELO framework was used to classify environmental factors. In total, 47 publications were identified. Social support and having a companion for physical activity were found to be convincingly associated with different types of physical activity [(neighbourhood) walking, bicycling, vigorous physical activity/sports, active commuting, leisure-time physical activity in general, sedentary lifestyle, moderately intense physical activity and a combination of moderately intense and vigorous activity]. Availability of physical activity equipment was convincingly associated with vigorous physical activity/sports and connectivity of trails with active commuting. Other possible, but less consistent correlates of physical activity were availability, accessibility and convenience of recreational facilities. No evidence was found for differences between men and women. In conclusion, supportive evidence was found for only very few presumed environmental determinants. However, most studies used cross-sectional designs and non-validated measures of environments and/or behaviour. Therefore, no strong conclusions can be drawn and more research of better quality is clearly needed.},

  abstract = {In many of the world's growing cities, semi-formal buses form the basis of public transit systems. However, little open and standardized data exist on these systems. The Digital Matatus project in Nairobi, Kenya set out to test whether the geo-locative capabilities of mobile technology could be used to collect data on a semi-formal transit system and whether that data could be translated into the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data standard for wider use. The results of this work show that mobile technologies, particularly mobile phones, which are increasingly prevalent in developing countries, can indeed be used effectively to collect and deliver data in a modified GTFS format for semi-formal transit. Perhaps more importantly, through our work in Nairobi, we were able to identify the benefits and technical needs for developing data on semi-formal transit. Overall, the work illustrates (1) how the GTFS can be adapted to semi-formal systems and used by other cities with such transit systems, (2) that there is demand from technologists as well as transport communities for comprehensive data on semi-formal transit, (3) that releasing the data openly in the GTFS standard format can help to encourage the development of transportation applications, and (4) that including the entire transit community during the data development can create a community of users and mechanisms for institutionalizing a process of data updating and sharing. The engagement strategies our research team developed around the data collection process in Nairobi became just as important as the resulting data it produced.},

Yet access to information including geographic information systems (GIS) is challenging, particularly as data are often seen as a commodity or source of power by those who control it, a dynamic more severe in contexts like Kenya. By generating GIS data for our own transportation model and then sharing them with those interested in doing research on Nairobi, we experienced firsthand some of the power dynamics associated with accessing and generating information in the developing country context. The project had several important lessons: (1) Simply developing data does not make them open; how ``open access'' is provided to the data is just as important as making them freely available. (2) Developing data can show commitment to a particular place or project that can help generate support for stronger partnerships and project goals. (3) Openly sharing data about place might help push those with access to information to share information as well. Overall this research project illustrated that sharing data can help support a more open access ecosystem locally by establishing a culture of data sharing but only if those interested in using it have the technical ability to both access and use data sets provided.},

  abstract = {The triple threats of climate change, resource depletion and energy security have led to a need to re-think the way in which we build and regenerate our cities. Increasingly low carbon infrastructure, buildings and lifestyles are being encouraged in urban areas. This trend has resulted in the emergence of a number of low carbon demonstration projects in cities across the world. The planning process is one of many tools in the armory for delivering low carbon development. It has a clear role in the delivery of low carbon demonstration projects and may also be used to encourage wider deployment of low carbon systems in cities. It has several roles - strategic, regulatory and facilitation (identified by planning theory) - all of which can be used to assist in the delivery of low carbon development. Strategic planning can be used to coordinate resource and development strategies as well as encourage the alterations to urban form needed to support the deployment of low carbon technologies. The planning process itself can be manipulated to reduce the cost of low carbon development; used to facilitate discussion between key players involved in delivering low carbon development; and build support for low carbon infrastructure in communities. In its regulatory role planning can be used to enforce the adoption of low carbon infrastructure in communities. The role of planning in delivering low carbon development will be investigated in this paper using a two case studies fromEurope. Theweakness of planning as a tool for delivering lowcarbon development and the factors which can provide greater leverage are also explored using case study examples. Finally the future role for the planning system in delivering low carbon development is discussed. \textcopyright{} 2012 Taylor \& Francis.},

  abstract = {Census data can be represented both as lists and as tabulations ofhousehold/individual attributes. List representation of Census data offers greater flexibility, as the exploration of interrelationships between population characteristics is limited only by the quality and scope of the data collected. Unfortunately, the released lists of household/individual attributes (Samples of Anonymised Records, SARs) are spatially referenced only to areas (single or merged districts) with populations of 120 000 or more, whereas released tabulations are available for units as small as single enumeration districts (Small Area Statistics, SAS). Intuitively, it should be possible to derive list-based estimates of enumeration district populations by combining information contained in the SAR and the SAS. In this paper we explore the range of solutions that could be adapted to this problem which, ultimately, is presented as a complex combinatorial optimisation problem. Various techniques of combinatorial optimisation are tested, and preliminary results from the best performing algorithm are evaluated. Through this process, the lack of suitable test statistics for the comparison of observed and expected tabulations of population data is highlighted.},

  abstract = {Communicative rationality offers a new paradigm for transportation planning. Drawing on the literature and lessons from transportation planning practice, this paper describes the characteristics of a ``communicative'' form of transportation planning and compares them with conventional practices. A communicative rationality paradigm would place language and discourse at the core of transportation planning. The paper argues that it would lead to greater attention to desired transportation ends (goals), better integration of means and ends, new forms of participation and learning, and enhanced deliberative capacity. The paper explains the implications of this paradigm for the role of the transportation planner, the purpose of planning, the planning process, communicative practices, problem framing, and the nature of planning analysis. The paper concludes with an assessment of communicative rationality's ability to promote more effective transportation planning. It seeks to create a dialogue that will support the investigation of new transportation planning processes.},

  abstract = {The bicycle is almost unique among human-powered machines in that it uses human muscles in a near-optimum way. This new edition of the bible of bicycle builders and bicyclists provides just about everything you could want to know about the history of bicycles, how human beings propel them, what makes them go faster, and what keeps them from going even faster. The scientific and engineering information is of interest not only to designers and builders of bicycles and other human-powered vehicles but also to competitive cyclists, bicycle commuters, and recreational cyclists.The third edition begins with a brief history of bicycles and bicycling that demolishes many widespread myths. This edition includes information on recent experiments and achievements in human-powered transportation, including the "ultimate human- powered vehicle," in which a supine rider in a streamlined enclosure steers by looking at a television screen connected to a small camera in the nose, reaching speeds of around 80 miles per hour. It contains completely new chapters on aerodynamics, unusual human-powered machines for use on land and in water and air, human physiology, and the future of bicycling. This edition also provides updated information on rolling drag, transmission of power from rider to wheels, braking, heat management, steering and stability, power and speed, and materials. It contains many new illustrations.},

  abstract = {Large and unofficial data sets, for instance those gathered from social media, are increasingly being used in geographical research and explored as decision support tools for policy development. Social media data have the potential to provide new insight into phenomena about which there is little information from conventional sources. Within this context, this paper explores the potential of social media data to evaluate the aesthetic management of landscape. Specifically, this project utilises the perceptions of visitors to the Pennine Way National Trail, which passes through land managed under the Environmental Stewardship Scheme (ESS). The method analyses sentiment in trail users' public Twitter messages (tweets) with the aim of assessing the extent to which the ESS maintains landscape character within the trail corridor. The method demonstrates the importance of filtering social media data to convert it into useful information. After filtering, the results are based on 161 messages directly related to the trail. Although small, this sample illustrates the potential for social media to be used as a cheap and increasingly abundant source of information. We suggest that social media data in this context should be seen as a resource that can complement, rather than replace, conventional data sources such as questionnaires and interviews. Furthermore, we provide guidance on how social media could be effectively used by conservation bodies, such as Natural England, which are charged with the management of areas of environmental value worldwide.},

Hierarchical statistical models offer a framework for sampling design and analysis that can be used to incorporate the information collected at finer scales while allowing comparison at coarser scales. In this study we use a Hierarchical Bayesian model to assess the relationship between measurements collected on the ground at centimeter scales nested within 2???3m quadrats, which are in turn nested within much larger (0.1?12 ha) plots. We compare these measurements with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from radiometrically and geometrically corrected 30-m resolution LANDSAT ETM+?data to assess the NDVI?Biomass relationship in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. Our novel modeling approach allows the data observed at submeter scales to be incorporated directly into the model and thus all the data (and variability) collected at finer scales are represented in the estimates of biomass at the LANDSAT scale. The model reveals that there is a strong correlation between NDVI and biomass, which supports the use of NDVI in spatiotemporal analysis of vegetation dynamics in Mediterranean shrubland ecosystems. The methods developed here can be easily generalized to other ecosystems and ecophysiological parameters.},

Bike Score\textregistered{} is a metric capturing environmental characteristics associated with cycling that is now available for over 160 US and Canadian cities. Our aim was to determine if Bike Score was associated with between and within-city variability in cycling behavior. Methods: We used linear regression to model associations between Bike Score and journey to work cycling mode share (US: American Community Survey, 2013 or 2012 5-year estimates; Canada: 2011 National Household Survey) for 5664 census tracts in 24 US and Canadian cities. Results: At the city level, the correlation between mean Bike Score and mean journey to work cycling mode share was moderate (r = 0.52). At the census tract level, the correlation was 0.35; a ten-unit increase in Bike Score was associated with a 0.5 \% (95 \% CI: 0.5 to 0.6) increase in the proportion of population cycling to work, a meaningful difference given the low modal shares (mean = 1.9 \%) in many North American cities. Census tracts with the highest Bike Scores (90 to 100) had mode shares 4.0 \% higher ({$\beta$} = 4.0, 95 \% CI: 2.9 to 5.0) than the lowest Bike Score areas (0\textendash 25). City specific analyses indicated between-city variability in associations, with regression estimates between Bike Score and mode share ranging from 0.2 to 3.5 \%. Conclusions: The Bike Score metric was associated bicycle mode share between and within cities, suggesting its utility for planning bicycle infrastructure.},

  abstract = {A growing body of evidence links the built environment to physical activity levels, health outcomes, and transportation behaviors. However, little of this research has focused on cycling, a sustainable transportation option with great potential for growth in North America. This study examines associations between decisions to bicycle (versus drive) and the built environment, with explicit consideration of three different spatial zones that may be relevant in travel behavior: trip origins, trip destinations, and along the route between. We analyzed 3,280 utilitarian bicycle and car trips in Metro Vancouver, Canada made by 1,902 adults, including both current and potential cyclists. Objective measures were developed for built environment characteristics related to the physical environment, land use patterns, the road network, and bicyclespecific facilities. Multilevel logistic regression was used to model the likelihood that a trip was made by bicycle, adjusting for trip distance and personal demographics. Separate models were constructed for each spatial zone, and a global model examined the relative influence of the three zones. In total, 31\% (1,023 out of 3,280) of trips were made by bicycle. Increased odds of bicycling were associated with less hilliness; higher intersection density; less highways and arterials; presence of bicycle signage, traffic calming, and cyclistactivated traffic lights; more neighborhood commercial, educational, and industrial land uses; greater land use mix; and higher population density. Different factors were important within each spatial zone. Overall, the characteristics of routes were more influential than origin or destination characteristics. These findings indicate that the built environment has a significant influence on healthy travel decisions, and spatial context is important. Future research should explicitly consider relevant spatial zones when investigating the relationship between physical activity and urban form.},

  abstract = {Introduction Bicycling is promoted as a transportation and population health strategy globally. Yet bicycling has low uptake in North America (1\%\textendash 2\% of trips) compared with European bicycling cities (15\%\textendash 40\% of trips) and shows marked sex and age trends. Safety concerns due to collisions with motor vehicles are primary barriers.To attract the broader population to bicycling, many cities are making investments in bicycle infrastructure. These interventions hold promise for improving population health given the potential for increased physical activity and improved safety, but such outcomes have been largely unstudied. In 2016, the City of Victoria, Canada, committed to build a connected network of infrastructure that separates bicycles from motor vehicles, designed to attract people of `all ages and abilities' to bicycling.This natural experiment study examines the impacts of the City of Victoria's investment in a bicycle network on active travel and safety outcomes. The specific objectives are to (1) estimate changes in active travel, perceived safety and bicycle safety incidents; (2) analyse spatial inequities in access to bicycle infrastructure and safety incidents; and (3) assess health-related economic benefits. Methods and analysis The study is in three Canadian cities (intervention: Victoria; comparison: Kelowna, Halifax). We will administer population-based surveys in 2016, 2018 and 2021 (1000 people/city). The primary outcome is the proportion of people reporting bicycling. Secondary outcomes are perceived safety and bicycle safety incidents. Spatial analyses will compare the distribution of bicycle infrastructure and bicycle safety incidents across neighbourhoods and across time. We will also calculate the economic benefits of bicycling using WHO's Health Economic Assessment Tool. Ethics and dissemination This study received approval from the Simon Fraser University Office of Research Ethics (study no. 2016s0401). Findings will be disseminated via a website, presentations to stakeholders, at academic conferences and through peer-reviewed journal articles.},

  abstract = {Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) has been demonstrated to provide efficient and effective public transport that can even increase transit ridership and attractiveness within defined urban corridors in both developing and developed countries. The merit of the BRT system lies in its ability to provide a high quality public transit service with limited infrastructure and at a relatively low capital and operating cost. In this paper an attempt is made to review BRT characteristics in some detail. An overview of the elements of BRT systems: the running ways, vehicles, stations, as well as operational control, fare collection and passenger information systems is presented. This paper also discusses how these elements allows BRT services to achieve the speed, capacity, reliability, accessibility and operational safety characteristics that distinguishes such systems from regular express bus services. Each built BRT system is unique and depends on how these basic elements are designed and integrated. Environmental, social and economic impacts, users' perception and modal shift towards BRT have also been critically reviewed. With the presence of local land use and transport policies that support high-density and mixed developments, BRT has been found to attract potential developments around stations and along its corridor, increasing land values and promoting sustainable development. As reported in the literature, the infrastructure costs vary greatly depending on the costs of land acquisition, station design, degree of separation from traffic, technological features and material, labor costs. Thus, BRT capital costs cannot be generalized and must be transferred carefully based on the changes of the input costs that vary from one place to another. The barriers to BRT that block the achievement of significant success in customer satisfaction and ridership gains are mentioned with specific case studies. The review of BRT indicates that in some cases it has similar performance to higher order public transit; however, it still has its unique characteristics that set it apart.},

  abstract = {For a fixed bus route, the path is the fundamental parameter that determines the passenger catchment area, which, via the dispatching policy, determines the timetable and fleet size. However, the path cannot be chosen independent of the other parameters; they have a symbiotic relationship, even though the planning time frames are different ranging from `years' for the path of the route to `days' for the crew schedule. The express route planning problem deals with the optimum selection of the sequence of passenger generators to be served by the planned route. An analytical model is developed to enable minimization of operating cost and costs of passenger access, waiting and travel times. Applications of this model have provided an insight to the relative importance of different cost components. The analytical model first selects an initial trial path for the purpose of comparison and then the optimum path is sought by considering a process of swapping, adding and removing generators or extending the route. Routes based on both grid and non-grid road networks are considered. In particular, non-grid road network based routes have a clear optimum. The cost of access is shown to be the influential parameter with respect to route selection. The insights gained from such analysis are highlighted.},

In this study we used public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) mapping and global positioning system (GPS) tracking to monitor mountain bikers frequenting national parks for tourism and recreation in Northern Sydney, Australia. PPGIS was implemented using both an internet application and with hardcopy maps in the field. Our research addressed two fundamental questions for park planning: (1) What is the spatial distribution of visitor activities and location-specific reasons for riding; and (2) What location-specific actions are needed to improve riding experiences? The spatial distributions of riding activities generated in PPGIS showed strong correlation with the GPS tracking results, with riding locations being related to the reasons for track selection. Riders proposed a broad range of management actions to improve riding experiences. PPGIS mapping provides a cost-effective approach to facilitate spatial decision making, allowing park agencies to prioritise future visitor management actions. We discuss the strengths and limitations of these research methods.},

  abstract = {Abstract Visualizing flows between origins and destinations can be straightforward when dealing with small numbers of journeys or simple geographies. Lines embedded in geographic space have commonly been used in mapping transport flows, especially when geographic patterns are important, as they are when characterizing cities or managing transportation. For larger numbers of flows, however, this approach requires careful design to avoid problems of occlusion, salience bias, and information overload. Driven by the requirements identified by users and managers of the London Bicycle Hire scheme, we present three methods of representation of bicycle-hire use and travel patterns. Flow maps with curved flow symbols are used to show overviews in flow structures. Gridded views of docking-station locations that preserve geographic relationships are used to explore docking-station status over space and time in a graphically efficient manner. Origin?Destination maps that visualize the OD matrix directly while maintaining geographic context are used to provide visual details on demand. We use these approaches to identify changes in travel behaviour over space and time, to aid station rebalancing, and to provide a framework for incorporating travel modelling and simulation.},

This article re-examines UK renewable energy policy by analysing the internal and external failures of the various mechanisms to determine if Government has learnt from previous experience in reforming the RO. Government did not learn from their own actions during the NFFO/RO transition, evidenced by high-levels of similarity in internal/external failures. The reformed-RO is expected to significantly increase deployment, has provided a 'renewables package' by comprehensively addressing both internal/external failures but major internal failures (price/financial risk) still remain, resulting in contiguous failures over two decades and two mechanism changes (NFFO, RO, RO/reformed-RO). Success will again be heavily dependent on a select few technologies and new/untested measures to combat external failures. Mechanism-extension to 2037 is probably the single most important factor underlying potential deployment increases. However, introducing a FIT-like system via the sheer number of 'bolt-on' reforms to counter policy failures indicates loss of direction and clarity. Overall, although Government appears to have learnt some of its lessons from the past two-decades, significant doubt remains whether renewable energy policy objectives will be met via the latest mechanism change. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Background A modal shift to cycling has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide health co-benefits. Methods, models, and tools are needed to estimate the potential for cycling uptake and communicate to policy makers the range of impacts this would have. Methods and findings The Impacts of Cycling Tool (ICT) is an open source model with a web interface for visualising travel patterns and comparing the impacts of different scenarios of cycling uptake. It is currently applied to England. The ICT allows users to visualise individual and trip-level data from the English National Travel Survey (NTS), 2004\textendash 2014 sample, 132,000 adults. It models scenarios in which there is an increase in the proportion of the population who cycle regularly, using a distance-based propensity approach to model which trips would be cycled. From this, the model estimates likely impact on travel patterns, health, and greenhouse gas emissions. Estimates of nonoccupational physical activity are generated by fusing the NTS with the English Active People Survey (APS, 2013\textendash 2014, 559,515 adults) to create a synthetic population. Under `equity' scenarios, we investigate what would happen if cycling levels increased equally among all age and gender categories, as opposed to in proportion to the profile of current cyclists. Under electric assist bike (pedelecs or `e-bike') scenarios, the probability of cycling longer trips increases, based on the e-bike data from the Netherlands, 2013\textendash 2014 Dutch Travel Survey (50,868 adults).Outcomes are presented across domains including transport (trip duration and trips by mode), health (physical activity levels, years of life lost), and car transport\textendash related CO2 emissions. Results can be visualised for the whole population and various subpopulations (region, age, gender, and ethnicity). The tool is available at www.pct.bike/ict. If the proportion of the English population who cycle regularly increased from 4.8\% to 25\%, then there would be notable reductions in car miles and passenger related CO2 emissions (2.2\%) and health benefits (2.1\% reduction in years of life lost due to premature mortality). If the new cyclists had access to e-bikes, then mortality reductions would be similar, while the reduction in car miles and CO2 emissions would be larger (2.7\%). If take-up of cycling occurred equally by gender and age (under 80 years), then health benefits would be marginally greater (2.2\%) but reduction in CO2 slightly smaller (1.8\%). The study is limited by the quality and comparability of the input data (including reliance on self-report behaviours). As with all modelling studies, many assumptions are required and potentially important pathways excluded (e.g. injury, air pollution, and noise pollution). Conclusion This study demonstrates a generalisable approach for using travel survey data to model scenarios of cycling uptake that can be applied to a wide range of settings. The use of individual-level data allows investigation of a wide range of outcomes, and variation across subgroups. Future work should investigate the sensitivity of results to assumptions and omissions, and if this varies across setting.},

  abstract = {We examine the links between fossil-fuel-based transportation, greenhouse-gas emissions, and health. Transport-related carbon emissions are rising and there is increasing consensus that the growth in motorised land vehicles and aviation is incompatible with averting serious climate change. The energy intensity of land transport correlates with its adverse health effects. Adverse health effects occur through climate change, road-traffic injuries, physical inactivity, urban air pollution, energy-related conflict, and environmental degradation. For the world's poor people, walking is the main mode of transport, but such populations often experience the most from the harms of energy-intensive transport. New energy sources and improvements in vehicle design and in information technology are necessary but not sufficient to reduce transport-related carbon emissions without accompanying behavioural change. By contrast, active transport has the potential to improve health and equity, and reduce emissions. Cities require safe and pleasant environments for active transport with destinations in easy reach and, for longer journeys, public transport that is powered by renewable energy, thus providing high levels of accessibility without car use. Much investment in major road projects does not meet the transport needs of poor people, especially women whose trips are primarily local and off road. Sustainable development is better promoted through improving walking and cycling infrastructures, increasing access to cycles, and investment in transport services for essential needs. Our model of London shows how increased active transport could help achieve substantial reductions in emissions by 2030 while improving population health. There exists the potential for a global contraction and convergence in use of fossil-fuel energy for transport to benefit health and achieve sustainability.},

This study uses an Integrated Transport and Health Impact Modelling tool (ITHIM) to evaluate the health and environmental impacts of high walking and cycling transport scenarios for English and Welsh urban areas outside London.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nMETHODS: Three scenarios with increased walking and cycling and lower car use were generated based upon the Visions 2030 Walking and Cycling project. Changes to carbon dioxide emissions were estimated by environmental modelling. Health impact assessment modelling was used to estimate changes in Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) resulting from changes in exposure to air pollution, road traffic injury risk, and physical activity. We compare the findings of the model with results generated using the World Health Organization's Health Economic Assessment of Transport (HEAT) tools.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nRESULTS: This study found considerable reductions in disease burden under all three scenarios, with the largest health benefits attributed to reductions in ischemic heart disease. The pathways that produced the largest benefits were, in order, physical activity, road traffic injuries, and air pollution. The choice of dose response relationship for physical activity had a large impact on the size of the benefits. Modelling the impact on all-cause mortality rather than through individual diseases suggested larger benefits. Using the best available evidence we found fewer road traffic injuries for all scenarios compared with baseline but alternative assumptions suggested potential increases.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nCONCLUSIONS: Methods to estimate the health impacts from transport related physical activity and injury risk are in their infancy; this study has demonstrated an integration of transport and health impact modelling approaches. The findings add to the case for a move from car transport to walking and cycling, and have implications for empirical and modelling research.},

These trips would mostly otherwise have been made on foot (31\%) or by public transport (47\%). To date there has been a trend towards fewer fatalities and injuries than expected on cycle hire bicycles. Using these observed injury rates, the population benefits from the cycle hire scheme substantially outweighed harms (net change -72 DALYs (95\% credible interval -110 to -43) among men using cycle hire per accounting year; -15 (-42 to -6) among women; note that negative DALYs represent a health benefit). When we modelled cycle hire injury rates as being equal to background rates for all cycling in central London, these benefits were smaller and there was no evidence of a benefit among women (change -49 DALYs (-88 to -17) among men; -1 DALY (-27 to 12) among women). This sex difference largely reflected higher road collision fatality rates for female cyclists. At older ages the modelled benefits of cycling were much larger than the harms. Using background injury rates in the youngest age group (15 to 29 years), the medium term benefits and harms were both comparatively small and potentially negative.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nCONCLUSION: London's bicycle sharing system has positive health impacts overall, but these benefits are clearer for men than for women and for older users than for younger users.

With the animation package, we can export the animations produced by R into a variety of formats, such as a web page, a GIF animation, a Flash movie, a PDF document, or an MP4/AVI video, so that users can publish the animations fairly easily. The design of this package is flexible enough to be readily incorporated into web applications, e.g., we can generate animations online with Rweb, which means we do not even need R to be installed locally to create animations. We will show examples of the use of animations in teaching statistics and in the presentation of statistical reports using Sweave or knitr. In fact, this paper itself was written with the knitr and animation package, and the animations are embedded in the PDF document, so that readers can watch the animations in real time when they read the paper (the Adobe Reader is required).\$\textbackslash backslash\$nAnimations can add insight and interest to traditional static approaches to teaching statistics and reporting, making statistics a more interesting and appealing subject.},

In this book, we show you how to use dynamic R Markdown documents to build static websites featuring R code (or other programming languages) with automatically rendered output such as graphics, tables, analysis results, and HTML widgets. The blogdown package is also suitable for technical writing with elements such as citations, footnotes, and LaTeX math. This makes blogdown an ideal platform for any website designed to communicate information about data science, data analysis, data visualization, or R programming.   Note that blogdown is not just for blogging or sites about R; it can also be used to create general-purpose websites. By default, blogdown uses Hugo, a popular open-source static website generator, which provides a fast and flexible way to build your site content to be shared online. Other website generators like Jekyll and Hexo are also supported.  In this book, you will learn how to:    Build a website using the blogdown package;   Create blog posts and other website content as dynamic documents that can be easily edited and updated;   Customize Hugo templates to suit your site's needs;   Publish your website online;   Migrate your existing websites to blogdown and Hugo.

The main theme of this book is to understand the complexity of transportation development and model the process of network growth including its determining factors, which may be topological, morphological, temporal, technological, economic, managerial, social or political. Using multidimensional concepts and methods, the authors develop a holistic framework to represent network growth as an open and complex process with models that demonstrate in a scientific way how numerous independent decisions made by entities such as travelers, property owners, developers, and public jurisdictions could result in a coherent network of facilities on the ground. Models are proposed from innovative perspectives including self-organization, degeneration, and sequential connection to interpret the evolutionary growth of transportation networks in explicit consideration of independent economic and regulatory initiatives. Employing these models, the authors survey a series of topics ranging from network hierarchy and topology to first mover advantage. The authors demonstrate, with a wide spectrum of empirical and theoretical evidence, that network growth follows a path that is not only logical in retrospect, but also predictable and manageable from a planning perspective. In the larger scheme of innovative transportation planning, this book provides a re-consideration of conventional planning practice and sets the stage for further development on the theory and practice of the next-generation, evolutionary planning approach in transportation, making it of interest to scholars and practitioners alike in the field of transportation.},

  abstract = {The advent of microsimulation approaches in travel demand modeling, wherein activity-travel patterns of individual travelers are simulated in time and space, has motivated the development of synthetic population generators. These generators typically use census-based marginal distributions on household attributes to generate joint distributions on variables of interest using standard iterative proportional fitting (IPF) procedures. Households are then randomly drawn from an available sample in accordance with the joint distribution such that household-level attributes are matched perfectly. However, these traditional procedures do not control for person-level attributes and joint distributions of personal characteristics. In this paper, a heuristic approach, called the Iterative Proportional Updating (IPU) algorithm, is presented to generate synthetic populations whereby both household-level and person-level characteristics of interest can be matched in a computationally efficient manner. The algorithm involves iteratively adjusting and reallocating weights among households of a certain type (cell in the joint distribution) until both household and person-level attributes are matched. The algorithm is illustrated with a small example, and then demonstrated in the context of a real-world application using small geographies (blockgroups) in the Maricopa County of Arizona in the United States. The algorithm is found to perform very well, both from the standpoint of matching household and person-level distributions and computation time. It appears that the proposed algorithm holds promise to serve as a practical population synthesis procedure in the context of activity-based microsimulation modeling.},

This human-dominated organism degrades natural habitats, simplifies species composition, disrupts hydrological systems and modifies energy flow and nutrient cycling. Sustainable urban development (SUD) is seen as a panacea to minimise these externalities caused by widespread human activities on the environment. The concept of SUD has been around over a considerably long time as the need to adopt environmentally sustainable behaviours made the international community commit to it. However, to date such development has not been achieved in large scales anywhere around the globe. This review paper aims to look at the SUD concept from the lens of planning and development integration to generate new insights and directions. The paper reports the outcome of the review of the literature on planning and development approaches\textemdash i.e. urban planning, ecological planning, urban development, SUD\textemdash and proposes a new process to support the efforts for achieving SUD\textemdash i.e. integrated urban planning and development process. The findings of this review paper highlight that adopting such holistic planning and development process generate a potential to further support the progress towards achieving sustainability agendas of our cities.},

  abstract = {Time geography represents the uncertainty of the space\textendash time position of moving objects through two basic structures, the space\textendash time path and space\textendash time prism, which are subject to the speed allowed in the travel environment. Thus, any attempt at a quantitative time-geographic analysis must consider the actual velocity with respect to space. In a trip, individuals tend to pass through structurally varying spaces, such as linear traffic networks and planar walking surfaces, which are not suitable for use in a single GIS spatial data model (i.e., network, raster) that is only applicable to a single spatial structure (i.e., point, line, polygon). In this study, a velocity model is developed for a traffic network and walking surface-constrained travel environment through the divide-and-conquer principle. The construction of this model can be divided into three basic steps: the spatial layering of the dual-constrained travel environment; independent modelling of each layer using different spatial data models; and generation of layer-based time-geographic framework by merging models of each layer. We demonstrate the usefulness of the model for studying the space\textendash time accessibility of a moving object over a study area with varying spatial structures. Finally, an example is given to analyse the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

Conventional questionnaire approaches that collect data for model calibration are both labor-intensive and time-consuming, and generally show a poor response rate. This study takes advantage of increasingly available vehicle GPS trajectory data to conduct spatial interaction model calibration. A Huff model for retail trading area analysis was used as an example. Model calibration and parameter validation were conducted based on over 63,000 taxi GPS trajectories for seven major shopping centers in Wuhan, a large city in China. The results were positive and in general showed satisfactory descriptive and predictive capability. This study demonstrated the feasibility of using the emerging technology to calibrate spatial interaction models (and also showed the potential for use in other related studies). The main advantage of using these new data sources is that they allow efficient use of increasingly available positioning data, which is easier to collect than conventional customer surveys, and usually with larger data sizes. It also allows inferences to be made about distance-decay rates based on accurate computation of travel time and distance. This could save both time and expense in many related areas of research, while achieving high quality model calibration results. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Regional disparities in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from airports at the city level are of increasing importance for low-carbon development of the civil aviation sector. However, CO2 emissions from airport operations have rarely been estimated and discussed. We investigate the main driving forces of airport CO2 emissions by using Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models, separately, to investigate whether urbanization drives airport CO2 emissions and to investigate spatial heterogeneity at the city level. Nighttime light (NTL) data from satellite observations are adopted as a proxy for urbanization. We obtained energy consumption data by end-use purpose for 70 airports in China and calculated the CO2 emissions from on-ground airport operations. The median CO2 emissions of the 70 sample airports are estimated to be 15.9 million tonnes for 2015. Results from the GWR model indicate that airport CO2 emissions are affected by five main factors: urbanization, foreign direct investment, the share of tertiary industry in gross domestic output, passenger turnover of civil aviation and passenger turnover of railways. The elasticity of urbanization shows an increasing trend from the east of China to the west. The spatial heterogeneity of the CO2 emissions of the five airport clusters that are located in five urban agglomerations is discussed. In order to achieve effective reductions of CO2 emissions from airports, policy-makers should consider the spatial heterogeneity of the major driving factors of carbon emissions in different regions to avoid carbon lock-in.},

  abstract = {Shared bicycles provide a convenient mobility option to commuters especially for short-distance trips. Nevertheless, it also presents a challenge to bicycle-sharing operators as they have to deal with reallocation issues, i.e. removing bicycles from parking facilities which are at or near capacity and refilling parking facilities that are in need of bicycles. Few studies in the literature have actually tried understanding why certain docking stations are prone to excessive demand or suffer from a lack of parking supply. This paper attempts to identify the demographic, built-environment and transport-infrastructure indicators that can potentially aid policy-makers and operators in identifying parking facilities prone to bicycle reallocation. In particular, we have adopted the bicycle sharing operations in Nanjing, China as a case study to understand how such indicators can be identified for appropriate parking infrastructural enhancements. To achieve this goal, this study has established zero-inflated negative binomial models using multi-source data including point-of-interest (POI), daily weather, transit stop location, demographic data and bike-share smart card data. The model results obtained from this study suggest that built environment correlates significantly to shared bicycle reallocation count. In general, bicycle docking stations with large reallocation counts are more likely to be found near residences, bus stops, metro stations, employment areas, restaurants, amenities, parks, sports facilities, and clinics/hospitals; while stations near entertainment facilities, places of attraction, hotels, shopping malls, and educational institution tend to have balanced demand and supply. Analysis on the elasticity values revealed that mean temperature and station capacity are the most influential factors in bicycle reallocation. Among all POIs, presence of restaurants and areas with high employment tend to exhibit strongly a need for morning bicycle removal and evening bicycle refilling at docked stations. Policy makers can provide actual guidelines in the planning of shared bicycle parking facilities using the findings and methodologies presented in this study.},

  abstract = {Public involvement in transportation improvement programming is becoming increasingly important as well as being a recommendation of federal legislation in the United States. Although most transportation planning agencies have not actively involved the public during this stage of the planning process, there are many benefits to doing so, such as, gaining support from the public for the funded project list, increasing the credibility of agencies, reducing project costs, and avoiding construction delays. Effective public involvement during the programming step incorporates inclusive participation, two-way communications, transparent processes, and serious treatment of the public's input. This paper presents a model for public involvement in the programming process with all these features using a web-based portal application with a Public Participation Geographic Information System (PPGIS). The process is composed of the following five steps: describing values and concerns, determining criteria, reviewing projects, evaluating scenarios, and creating reports. Challenges agencies may encounter in implementing such a system are also covered in this paper. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The distinctive characteristic of the proposed tool is the incorporation of bus riders' cognition, information processing, and decision-making process during their search for an appropriate bus transit travel plan. First, a two-level bus network data model is used to accommodate the hierarchical nature of travelers' information processing and decision making. Second, the interaction of users with the system is designed to follow the spatial and individual thinking of bus travelers in a more intuitive way. Third, we adopt an iterative optimization method for deriving multiple optional bus travel plans according to compatible travel and transfer impedance measurements. A prototype of the decision support system is implemented on the platform of commercial off-the-shelf GIS software.},

Students did not simply memorize procedures but were able to recognize when the procedures were applicable and to apply them. Most students were also able to use their understanding of the concept of factorization to help learn the procedures and to check their results. The method of learning from examples has now been tested successfully with a class covering the entire 3-year curriculum in algebra and geometry in a Chinese middle school.},

  abstract = {Background: Given the documented physical activity disparities that exist among low-income minority communities and the increased focused on socio-ecological approaches to address physical inactivity, efforts aimed at understanding the built environment to support physical activity are needed. This community-based participatory research (CBPR) project investigates walking trails perceptions in a high minority southern community and objectively examines walking trails. The primary aim is to explore if perceived and objective audit variables predict meeting recommendations for walking and physical activity, MET/minutes/week of physical activity, and frequency of trail use. Methods: A proportional sampling plan was used to survey community residents in this cross-sectional study. Previously validated instruments were pilot tested and appropriately adapted and included the short version of the validated International Physical Activity Questionnaire, trail use, and perceptions of walking trails. Walking trails were assessed using the valid and reliable Path Environmental Audit Tool which assesses four content areas including: design features, amenities, maintenance, and pedestrian safety from traffic. Analyses included Chi-square, one-way ANOVA's, multiple linear regression, and multiple logistic models. Results: Numerous (n = 21) high quality walking trails were available. Across trails, there were very few indicators of incivilities and safety features rated relatively high. Among the 372 respondents, trail use significantly predicted meeting recommendations for walking and physical activity, and MET/minutes/week. While controlling for other variables, significant predictors of trail use included proximity to trails, as well as perceptions of walking trail safety, trail amenities, and neighborhood pedestrian safety. Furthermore, while controlling for education, gender, and income; for every one time per week increase in using walking trails, the odds for meeting walking recommendations increased 1.27 times, and the odds for meeting PA recommendation increased 3.54 times. Perceived and objective audit variables did not predict meeting physical activity recommendations. Conclusions: To improve physical activity levels, intervention efforts are needed to maximize the use of existing trails, as well as improve residents' perceptions related to incivilities, safety, conditions of trail, and amenities of the walking trails. This study provides important insights for informing development of the CBPR walking intervention and informing local recreational and environmental policies in this southern community.},
